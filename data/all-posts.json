There was no AC, so we positioned cheap old fans to help maximize air flow into and out of the room.  As we all tried to hide the sweat (ew), we receive an e-mail announcing an upcoming organizational change. “Join us this Friday to hear more about the upcoming shift, as we position ourselves to take advantage of… ”, the message said. I started to sweat more. “What does this mean for me?” “Which group will I land in?\" “Why are we doing this?”It’s at this moment that you look to those around you and start sharing your thoughts and opinions. You all process this together, maybe feeling a sense of discomfort from the ambiguity. You go through emotional cycles for what this means, and all you have to help make sense of this is: (1) what you’ve been told by leaders, (2) what you’re hearing from other colleagues, and (3) what patterns you’ve observed in the past to inform what might happen going forward. And the third thing is what will propel you to create narratives (stories, explanations) to make sense of the incoming scenario (no, the scenario right in front of you). This is your information ecosystem. What is an information ecosystem?I’m going to define what this term means to me, because I have yet to find a definition that is satisfying (please share one with me if you have it!). Information Ecosystem = the local mass/collection of information around a given organization. There are information ecosystems for your family, your coworkers, your friends, your political ideology, etc. Hone in on the word “collection” for a second. A better way to articulate this is that it’s never the totality of information around you. You never know everything. You always have, what economists like to call, imperfect (or “asymmetric”) information. An ExampleHere’s an example: you work at a large company (one with over 1000 employees). You work in a department within that company, let’s call it Engineering. In Engineering, there are 150 of you, and that means there are 850 people who are not in Engineering. In this 1,000-person organization, there are 10 big bosses who manage teams who manage other teams. For each of these ten leaders, they have lines of communication with their leaders, who then play a game of telephone as they articulate what they heard from their boss. This continues, over and over again down the chain of command, and all the while signal loss is occurring. As one person communicates something to one person, they capture most (but almost never all) of the message, which leads them to communicate inaccurately to others, which leads to the original message from the top to get diluted.This process happens underneath each of the aforementioned ten big bosses, and before you know it you have many different narratives running around an organization. Some are harmless. Some are harmful. And by the time the big bosses are clarifying messaging, people already have their own narratives in their head, which are notoriously difficult to dislodge.To be in any organization is to play a game of telephone. You hear something from your leaders, and someone (unintentionally) communicates that something imperfectly, and then the very structure and backbone of that original idea evaporates slowly as it travels from person to person. Let me put this another way: each person’s information ecosystem is comprised of what they hear. But their ecosystem is imperfect and — because of that imperfection — original narratives get diluted and transformed into something that be misleading or just plain wrong. But there are steps you can take to help ensure this signal loss is minimized (more on that later). Keeping your information ecosystem healthy against forces that will break it downWe have many things working against our efforts to deliver information that can withstand signal loss. Some big factors include: A multi-tasking crisis where staying focused on one thing is extraordinarily difficult as many things battle for our attentionOur own personal biases + how we consume and process information in ways that confirms our own preconceived conclusions, errConfirmation bias, and people hearing what they want toGeneral limitations on how much information we can retainMany many more factors I’m leaving out hereBut there are ways to keep your ecosystem healthy. Some successful tactics I’ve seen deployed include:Keep messaging streamlined and simple. The more content/words ==> the less your colleagues will retain Constantly appreciate bounded rationality. In layman’s terms, there is but so much that a person can hold in their brains at any given timeHaving FAQs and 1-3 slide overviews for people to reference back toTalking point documents to ensure people who are disseminating information are armed with tangible words to utilizeHaving a group of people you communicate with regularly who will give you tips on how to better communicate points and (even better if they) find holes in your thinking or rationale, which can then be supplied back to leaders who can then revise their core pointstl;dr — feedback loopsHaving a communications plan that outlines how you’ll talk about a topic both internally to your company and, if applicable, externally to the marketIt’s when inconsistencies arise that trust breaks down ==> this leads to a whole other world of problemsLet’s go back to 2017. What happened after that initial e-mail?Still sitting in that hot ass room. So what happened? Well, utter distraction. People ceased to be as productive on projects, we spent hours talking about — and processing — what this all meant for us. We had tense conversations with our managers, we asked pointed questions to somewhat-senior leaders who usually weren’t empowered or knowledgeable enough to provide us with clear answers. We felt impatient. We lost trust, and although we eventually got through it and most people were happy, the journey there was tumultuous. The org change took two months, and during those two months I know I wasn’t as effective at, well, anything. This taught me a really powerful lesson about the importance of clear information and strong communicators. People who could both provide updates on the business and also understand and feel what their employees felt. I suspect it’s a big reason why broader work-oriented mediascape has been so focused on empathetic and compassionate leadership. It’s because the only constant is change, and we’re in an era where change happens faster than it ever has before. And what the communications plan won’t deliver for you is empathy, soul, warmth, optimism. Ah….those soft factors. Let me update that definition of info ecosystems I provided earlier. A better definition of “Information Ecosystem”My first definition totally lacked any appreciation for the soft factors of information. The tone you feel, the emotions you glean from others.  My first definition: Information Ecosystem = the local mass/collection of information around a given organization. My improved definition: Information Ecosystem = the local collection of information in a given organization, where information can include numbers, images, narratives, and also the feelings generated by the communication of these pieces of information. An ecosystem, then, is also impacted by how information is communicated. By the tone deployed by the communicator as they introduce narratives and respond to feedback from others who are trying to process said narratives. So what the heck does this mean for you?It means that when you are communicating change, you shouldn’t just think about communication as a one-and-done game. Communications, in the context of work, means reinforcement. It’s identifying when you’ll initially communicate something. It’s arming others communicators with black-and-white / crystal clear points on how to communicate, because you can’t (and shouldn’t) always be there when others are going through their own journey processing change. It’s ingesting feedback and making sure it gets back to the original narrative creators in an unfiltered way, so they can improve and communicate updates clearly. It means clearing up misconceptions quickly and head-on, and then checking in with people who will be honest to see, “did that land?”It means being authentic when you miscommunicated something, and being as clear as possible in both verbal, written, and graphical form about what is truth and what is not. The penalty for not investing time to clear up misconceptions is that inaccurate ideas grow and grow until they becomes weeds that seep resources from the rest of the garden that is the place you work. And one last point: weeds are going to appear in your garden. You are going to have to address them. They are unavoidable. I actually find this process of clarification to be extraordinarily healthy to re-earning trust + refining success pathways with quality feedback… But we should strive to minimize the presence of disinformation and misunderstanding (boy, I feel like this applies to way more than “work” as I re-read that sentence…). I would love to hear how you contend with signal loss and unhealthy information ecosystems, and ideally suggestions if you have any!

The three-week hiatus is over, and getting back into my writing groove here in Hotlanta (and it is hot — pretty sure it’s 95 degrees outside right now…). Been super into this book recently, and it inspired some thoughts around how earlier-stage companies could think more about how to upskill current employees and also ensure healthy investment in the infrastructure that they utilize. While I was escaping the cool this weekend, I spent some time almost finishing one of Ray Dalio’s recent books, The Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed or Fail. As he’s going through the rise and decline of empires over the last 1000 years (Asian, Dutch, British, American…), he writes about how countries that invest heavily in education & infrastructure have a significant advantage in remaining competitive and technologically vibrant. This is not a new lesson to me. Back when I was in school I absolutely devoured any content related to economic development, and in that course of study you come across a certain set of principles for how countries grow. They’re largely consistent — things like the rule of law, adequate defense spending, well thought-out geopolitical strategy, etc. etc. But I don’t often hear of leaders thinking about education & infrastructure in the context of a company. We probably call them different things, but let me apply it more bluntly. Education spending = funds spent on the education of a groupInfrastructure spending = funds spent to give people access to physical and digital tools that help them live better lives. While there are certainly differences between a country and a company, they both — at the end of the day — are a form of organization. Households, Neighborhoods, Cities, Counties, States, Regions can roughly equate to Sub-teams, teams, departments, organizations, and companies (this isn’t a perfect 1-1 match, but you get the point). Just like we think about infrastructure and education spending at the political level in our countries, so too should we about these factors within our own companies. Ongoing education within a company is what helps keep it vibrant, and what helps to ensure that a culture remains inclusive. I, for one, have deeply appreciated the education I’ve received on things like unconscious bias, for example Ongoing education can take other forms too: learning a new software development framework, learning how to become a more effective public speaker, understanding a new customer success framework, etc. etc. Similarly, infrastructure spending can significantly increase the productivity of a citizenry / employee base. Just like shitty roads and unreliable bridges can disrupt the flow of people to places of commerce, so too can painfully slow internet, subpar software, unreliable cloud infrastructure, or lack of data to improve how people do their jobs (example: try being in sales and not having any data on prospects… not fun!)I don’t think this is such a novel idea, but I will say that more attention should be given to these two categories of spend for companies that are in the earlier stages…Here are some tactics that earlier-stage companies can deploy across these two categories: Ensure that your employees have learning & development goals from day 1and invest in them. This oftentimes can take the form of a company outright paying for you to get a certain certification or take a certain courseRegularly do reviews of IT subscription costs. Noticing that one of your teams is spending $50-$1000 per month on software. Ask them why, and potentially setup a pilot or evaluation period to see if said software could add value to others in your company When employees start having IT/computer (read: infrastructure) challenges, do a triage to understand why, and then move fast to get them setup with tools that allow them to move efficiently ASAPBad example: I routinely would lose 3-5 hours of productivity every few weeks from a painfully slow computer that my former employer would not replace. In those hours, I was unable to finish proposals, attend key calls, or keep my team moving quickly —> resulted in way more costs and/or lost revenue than it would’ve taken to replace said laptopInvest in opt-in programming for employees to learn new skills or ways of operating. Literally get things on the calendar. Ally.io was amazing about this, and some of the programs we were able to attend significantly changed the way I thought about life and work (in fact, this newsletter partially started after I came across a very powerful idea — leadership from everywhere — in a company-sponsored program Be careful to not go overboard. In each of the above points, costs must always be considered of course (especially in this market!), but as with most things in life: there’s probably a happy middle… In general, an organization should be able to point to some way they have improved or upgraded the education or infrastructure their employees use every single quarter. The risks of stagnation are too great.

I’ve promised myself to not do any work + avoid internet, so I’ll probably write a few essays and bulk publish them once I’m back in mid-June*First, some backgroundWhen I built out my own personal framework for interviewing + hiring, I thought deeply about what I didn’t like about interviewing when I was earlier in my career. One of the biggest things that bubbled up to the top for me was the feeling of walking on eggshells. I was trying to please every interviewer… to “make a good impression” … to “build rapport.” I tip-toed on eggshells effectively enough to secure full-time offers, but then as I spent more time at work, I started to notice a trend: oftentimes the most difficult people were in leadership positions. I really, truly struggled with this, particularly in the first couple of years of work where this guy, let’s call him Jamie, was revered in the office by everyone. He walked around like he owned the place, and everyone alluded to him as quite literally, “The Chosen One.” (can’t make this shit up). And then, a realizationBut as I started to get closer to him…to watch him operate, I realized why people were so enamored with him — he was downright brutal in meetings. …And could get better results than any other manager —> made him look very good in the eyes of senior management —> the rest is history (this person is now a very senior executive at a large company). I couldn’t bring myself to adopt this guy’s playbook, but I wasn’t going to just ignore the lessons in his interim and long-term success. There was something Jamie was doing — he was not shying away from conflict. He was in fact embracing conflict, head on, without any fear. Some people call this being brash, some people call it being aggressive, some people call it being bold. Call it whatever you want, but the ability to disagree with others is of paramount importance to high-performing teams. It’s just that Jamie went about it in a rather off-putting way.This is when I discovered the power of mixing candor with genuine kindness and empathy. I basically said, “How can I be as or more effective than this guy…but not be an asshole?”I started testing different ways to operate…I started testing this out — being warm but also openly disagreeing with others… After some failed runs, I started to tune the way you present disagreement, and before long I was getting the very same opportunities Jamie had gotten, but without the trail of figurative destruction behind me.I tell this story because I basically always try to hire not-Jamie’s. I want to work with people who are kind, welcoming, but very willing to disagree. Over the years, after so many hundreds of mini projects, you start to uncover patterns around when the very best work is done, and it was almost always with people who embraced disagreement, both on the receiving and giving ends.I’ve had this guideline in the back of my head for probably the last five years, and I know it has served me well, simply by measuring the number of high-likelihood-of-failure projects we’ve all executed together that have somehow…. turned out to be home runs. How to apply this guidelineA quick note on execution: applying this rule requires a pretty thorough interview process, a process deep enough to get to the point of highly dynamic, back-and-forth conversation. The way I’ve typically done this is by either: Presenting a current challenge our business is facing and asking for the candidates thoughts across several dimensions, and/orThen ask them to argue the opposite case, and gauge how deep they can go on why to not pursue a certain pathAsking them questions like, “what is something you think most people would disagree with you on?”, orDirectly asking for feedback, either on the interview process or even on how I could’ve provided a better experience Critically, you must capture one, material piece of feedback either for you or your company. This is the real gauge — if you’re thinking about how we could be better before Day 1, that bodes well for Day 1000 on the job, after you’ve helped us upgrade our capabilities as an organizationThe deeper point hereHowever you might implement something like this, let me be very clear on the actual root intent here. The point of this is to ensure you’re hiring people who can, at the very least, simulate a variety of perspectives, assess multiple options, and communicate various options effectively, without succumbing to the pressure to agree or go with the flow of the team. In other words, find people who can challenge groupthink… It is this see-sawing between options that leads to more thoughtful planning and realization of goals.1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 020 - Why I (Strive To) Only Hire People Who Can Disagree With MeCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I’ve been particularly fortunate to work with truly game-changing colleagues, who are smart, driven, humble, and candid. The one thing they all have in common is that they have all done multiple roles at work (or in school!) that were incredibly challenging. The kinds of opportunities that push people to the limits of their capabilities, and beyond. In Letter 005 (Active Career Management) and Letter 007 (Having Multiple Jobs (no, it doesn't have to be at multiple organizations)), I talk about how learning compounds, and that if you maximize learning early in your career, it’ll pay immense dividends down the road.The way to nurture the power of compounded learning for your team is to occasionally provide Super Stretch Assignments. A Super Stretch is a project or role at work that you know will push someone beyond the bounds of their current capabilities. It will likely create stress. It will likely lead to some instances of failure/setbacks for the employee. It likely won’t be smooth… In other words, if your primary goal is to avoid failure, you should NOT give out super stretch assignments. However, if your primary goal is to deliver a rate of incredible learning and breakthrough personal growth, the risk of setbacks can be worth it. I’ve personally been astounded by the things I’ve seen my colleagues accomplish. Oftentimes they’re very early in their career, but the Super Stretch fast-tracks them to a new, increased level of capability. Signs that you can give someone a Super Stretch:When you talk to them, you can easily envision them in a job that is at least one or two levels above where they currently areThe employee is asking for growth opportunitiesThe employee’s long-term aspirations are bold AF, and you want to help them get thereThe employee has a truly dynamic set of experiences and proof of past successYou feel overwhelmed with your current slate of responsibilities, and you want to give someone else a chance to lead :) Last thought: you can’t just throw a Super Stretch over the fence and walk away. You have to: Confirm that the employee is up for the challenge Ensure that your check-ins have plenty of space for active feedback delivery + co-processing (together)Have ultra clear success criteriaYou have a week-by-week or step-by-step plan to get to aforementioned success criteria Be comfortable with setbacks and be prepared to jump into help get the project/job on the right trackYou, as a leader, have to be ready to accept responsibility for setbacks and failuresThus, you should have backup plans in place in case things fall apartLastly, you must be prepared to offer candor & encouragement when things aren’t going well and reflect on the growth that person exhibits when you do see it after a setback…Because your colleagues deserve to be seen. They deserve to be appreciated, especially after they’ve taken a leap of faith. If you are a leader who routinely gives out “safe” assignments to your directs and their directs, know that you aren’t creating a breakthrough personal growth environment. Yes, you do need to balance out the number of Safe versus Stretch versus Super Stretch assignments; there should be a distribution across these categories. 1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 019 - The Super Stretch Assignment (Short Form)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

As a reminder, Exonomist is written in raw form, with typos and occasionally odd topical flow. I’m going to likely start shifting more to market / business strategy in the next few posts, a bit away from the more interpersonal topics I’ve been writing about for the past several weeks.Tl;dr — to break through in crowded markets, consider how your brand is positioned against other established players as a means to tell your story more passionately… Which should ideally be a part of your push to leave an impression on both the emotional and logical sides of your customers… Getting to these customers can sometimes be an expensive, infuriating journey, and you should establish discipline in reviewing marketing investment efficacy (ROMI) on a regular basis, allowing some longer-term bets to mature and grow, while also using data on interim performance to inform where to make adjustments.How can my product can breakthrough amidst of a wave of competitors?? This has been a prime pursuit since the dawn of commerce, where multiple providers went to market with competing products, and yet how people think about breaking through oftentimes leaves much to be desired. Typically, teams grasp a tactic superficially and apply it sub-optimally. Which is why most markets are comprised of companies that have stagnated and/or failed to execute grandiose sounding growth programs. Here’s a crappy example of a sub-component of a growth strategy I once came across on a marketing strategy project (we were reviewing the old marketing strategy, which had failed). Exact wording is escaping me, but it was extremely close to:We’re going to pursued a content-led growth, by publishing more articles on LinkedIn. It’s a proven tactic that other brands have utilized, and we have an opportunity to differentiate through our messaging. This is superficially grasping a tactic, but it lacked any sense of specificity or…rigor. Rigor = going deeper by asking questions like… Why have other attempts at this strategy failed? How can we avoid making the same mistakes? How will we know this strategy is working? When do we decide to abandon the approach? Who is the absolute best at doing this in our segment? Do they write a blog? Have they spoken at conferences? Are there hallmarks of their approach that we should consider? If we were 100% reliant on this one approach, what would we do to make damned sure it produced results? And ideally you land with something closer to this than what I wrote above…: “We are going to pursue a content-led growth (user acquisition) strategy that builds on a hyper specific appreciation of a persona group, and we are hiring a proven expert in this exact field on a 3-month contract, during which time we expect to see X content conversion rates. To support this strategy, we will invest Z dollars into marketing automation, and we will also have every executive at the company re-post/share said articles at least 1x per month, AND we will host three webinars fully centered around these topics that will be moderated by three different key opinion leaders in the space.” It’s specificIt’s multi-damned-prongedIt’s timebound (3 months)It is missing a key result ;-) But at least it’s specific about specific tactics to accelerate the experimentThis matters because winning in your market is not a given. At any given moment, someone (or someones) are out there conspiring to replace your company (coming back to this in a bit…). You have to be specific in your strategies and measurement mechanisms (aka, “Dude is this working??”) to make sure your product can thrive.As I type these words, I’m looking out at a collection of branches that just keep growing, and growing, and growing. They, much like companies, are trying to break through. They’re striving to capture as much of the sunlight as they can, they’re trying to dig roots that can last and capture water reliably, so that they can keep growing and capturing more sunlight, and so on and so forth. It’s pretty incredible how this battle for resources is happening all around us, and yet I rarely view this ecosystem of plants as a brutal competitive landscape. It’s life, trying to survive. It’s beautiful, calming, and when you look deeper there’s more to it than just branches growing.And that’s akin to a company, where many people have their livelihoods and reputations staked on business outcomes. That latest advertising campaign can seem so innocuous when you take it at face value, but it is a war for your attention, and a war for your share of wallet every time your eyes cross whatever brand asset that company paid for you to see. Alright, enough gazing at nature. How can a company break through in a crowded market to acquire users/customers? Here are the things that immediately come top of mind.Counter-positioningPurpose, Values, and StorytellingKick-ass customer experience (CX)Head & HeartBold PlaysConstant prioritization of marketing spendConstant capture of marketing dataLong-term earned media bets & KOLs (key opinion leaders)Variable, paid-media betsMinimizing gap between marketing, sales, and CXSales enablementI’m not going to write about all of these today. Instead, I’m going to pick out three of the areas that I have been most drawn to lately: (1) Counter-positioning, (2) Head & Heart, and (3) constant prioritization of marketing investments/spend. Will write about the other ones at some other point (oh you thought I was only going to write a few articles and stop? I’m just getting started :-)).1. Counter-positioningMan, I have been obsessed with this concept lately, not because it’s particularly groundbreaking, but because the term is so surgically awesome. David Rosenthal (one of my business knowledge heroes and angel investor who hosts a badass podcast I’ve referenced here several times, Acquired) has talked about this in the context of new venture capital firms emerging to challenge established incumbents, but I also think you can see countless examples of this happening in the market. Contrast is the mother of clarity — you see something oftentimes by seeing what it is NOT first…Apple (back in the day) positioning itself as the cool, design, luxury product against a staid (read: unadventurous) product lineRobinhood positioning itself as the refreshing, mobile-first trading platform as opposed to the old, hard-to-access platforms of the legacy consumer trading platformsNetflix deciding to release entire seasons of episodes at once, as opposed to the very entrenched strategy of week-by-week releases. Amazon positioning itself against legacy retailers by offering something few others could reliably: fast shippingFast Fashion companies pumping out new designs constantly, as opposed to always waiting for a new “season” to release new products Airbnb offering an experience fundamentally different than whatever most hotels were offering at the timeInsert any example of a brand that did the complete opposite of whatever the established incumbent wasIn business, this can be used to drive what another great book called Founders Mentality talks about as a “sense of insurgency” — the sense that you are doing something different from the established order, and that sense of being a part of something drives connection, and connection is ultimately a form of loyalty. It’s a phenomenal way to drive a wedge into a market, but to do it your product experience has to back up what your marketing is telling the market. Marketing efficacy tends to ware off over time, but a joy-producing customer experience and value over time tend to pay dividends.2. Head & HeartAn old colleague of mine, Larry M., was the first person I heard say this. He was leading an offering around human experience in a digital health context, and we were pitching a large biotech company on a customer experience strategy project (one of my first ever real pitches). He powerfully spoke about needing to connect to the Head of a customer (their logical brain) and the Heart (that intangible, harder-to-understand part of us that is more driven by emotional connection). While some products are truly exceptional on their own to not require much storytelling, there’s a reason you constantly see brands trying to build an emotional connection with you. It’s because emotions drive so much of our decision making, and if you only appeal to logic, you’re missing out on a big part of the human decision making cycle. Not accounting for emotion in customer acquisition is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back. Whenever I have pitched anything in my life (…quite a bit by this point in time! Have lost count of the number of sales pursuits or complex sales I’ve led or been a part of), I’ve always tried to appeal to the value someone gets on an emotional / “human” level and also to the value they would see on more purely financial + time-savings terms.  If it was just the latter, the appeal would feel…slightly empty? And that, to me, felt like a not-very-win-creating approach.And frankly, the organization that is taking a product to market could probably benefit from the storytelling about the impact they are making every day. 3. Constant Prioritization of (marketing) SpendI’ve talked about the importance of constant prioritization of spend before, most recently in letter 14, which was about the lessons I learned growing up in an entrepreneurial environment. This particular point, however, is ultra focused on marketing spend, since it can play such an outsized role in enabling a product to break through. For companies (especially new ones), creating “brand awareness” is one of the most important things you do, and there are countless ways to spend money. I’ve oftentimes observed earlier-stage companies absolutely obsessing over which marketing channels to explore (good!), and I oftentimes see startups under-appreciate the radical clarity that can come from analyzing ROMI (return on marketing investment). It’s so easy to want to throw money at this sponsorship, and that advertisement, and this webinar, and that conference… And just like everything else, it pays (off) to be thoughtful about where you are spending your resources. It’s easy to write the check and to forget the post-mortem about what value that check really delivered to your company… The best companies I see have a disciplined marketing investment strategy, where they are regularly (usually monthly, at least quarterly) reviewing every area of marketing spend, tracking what results they’ve achieved via this spend, and making fast decisions around which areas to increase, decrease, eliminate, or explore. It is in these reviews, that you’ll start to uncover the signals that tell you which marketing bets might hold outsized potential. In other words your portfolio of marketing investments should be actively (not passively) managed. Because few things (at work) suck more than spending months defining a Head-and-Heart-impacting brand messaging architecture, only for it to fall completely flat while you deploy said brand assets across channels that aren’t working. Counterpoint: some things take a longer time to pay off… It’s OK to make marketing bets that may not pay off immediately, but you should just be extra thoughtful when you make them. The excuse of, “well, this takes time” is reasonable, but it can easily become a crutch that veils mediocre thinking.

I’ve found myself leaving many days with my brain feeling extremely pushed by the sheer number of threads to manage, tasks to accomplish, conversations to have. In the midst of the back-to-back meeting world, how do we protect space for ourselves to think? Yeah, my GSD-GTD-GND way of thinking has been super helpful, but something was still missing. And finally, I realized what it was as I was talking to a client of mine, “Wasn’t it Steve Jobs who had talked about what you are Not going to do being (maybe) more important than what you do?” That idea spurred me to revive an old tactic of mine that worked really well when I was on particularly fast-paced projects: the Not Going To Do list. A few weeks ago, I started adding this to my Friday afternoon ritual of planning out the next week, and physically writing down the things I would not do. To say this has been valuable would be an understatement; it’s been game-changing. Writing out the items has been helpful, but it’s also helped me be proactive around timeline management with my colleagues at work. In one case on the work front, there was an assignment that was due today (Tuesday), and I knew that having to hit the Tuesday deadline would take up space for me to work on one of my top three priorities. So, on Friday, I sent a note to the working group I’m with, explained the need for a timeline adjustment, and simply stated why — “I have another thread I’m responsible for driving that has a key milestone on Wednesday. The team needs more energy there, so we are diverting attention to this priority early next week, and I’ll pick up this postponed thread early the week after next.”In another case on the personal front, it’s helped me to make sure I’m spending my free time in a way that brings joy. My commitment to myself this week was that, “I will NOT stay home every night this week (monday-thursday)” —> led me to reach out to a friend of mine who I hadn’t seen in a while. I’m going to keep experimenting with this over the next few weeks, but the interim results for me have been to: (1) increase the quality of my work, and (2) reduce my stress levels by helping to manage timelines more proactively.3Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 017 - \"Not Going to Do\" ListCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I’ve called this “Conversational Clock Management” (yes, I love the word management — i’ll find something more creative/differentiated later).What I listened to while writing this (after I pasted this link, Anderson said, “Ima leave the door open, girl…” and I want to be clear that this post is not about romance — not going to dive into that genre of writing… ……..yet)Clock management can be helpful in both challenging situations and every day lifeI use Clock Management almost every day of my life. Most of the time it’s in perfectly normal situations, usually when I’m trying to maximize inclusivity during meetings. What’s a great way to make sure everyone’s voice is heard? Ask everyone to think about something for 1-2 minutes in silence, and then get everyone’s opinions after that momentary time of stoppage.Sometimes, however, clock management is a way to get through a particularly difficult conversation in a way that you can feel proud of after the fact. Have you ever totally lost your shit while arguing with someone else? (If you haven’t, please confirm that you are: (A) human, and (B) please tell me how you do it). It doesn’t feel good to respond poorly to a situation involving others. Yes, it’s bound to happen, because we are not automotons, but you can minimize the frequency of this by being comfortable both with silence and asking for processing space. Here’s a story about a time where creating space allowed us to get to a resolution + feel proud of how we showed upOne of those times was as we were getting ready to load all of our boxes into a truck for our cross-country move last January. After barely sleeping for days while we power packed, we were finally ready to go. The dark grey skies of Seattle prevented nature from letting us know if it was 8am or 8pm. The feeling of melancholy setting in, with a vengeance. Boxes all around us. Our dog aggressively trying to murder the tape gun. The last time we’d get donuts from our favorite shop on the block. The movers arrive, and the truck is mighty small. Wait, it’s really small. Too small. Oh God. This is not going to fit our stuff… Our flight leaves early tomorrow morning. It’s a global pandemic, flying feels super risky to us. What are we going to do? Fast forward an hour, and Simi and I are locked in an intense negotiation (read: argument) with the moving company, who at the very last minute decided to multiply the cost of our already-expensive move by four times, despite our confirming the inventory / scope three times in the weeks before. As we reached a point of the conversation where both sides were quickly losing any sense of decorum, we decided to manage the clock. The conversation went something like this: Moving Company Guy insinuates that we’re trying to defraud themWe get incensed at this suggestion and start raising our voices (here, we are starting to lose our shit)Moving Company Guy gets even more incensed. Tears start flowingIntersection Point: We decide to manage the clock a little bitI say to the guy, let’s call him Johnny, something along the lines of: “Johnny, look. I need some time to process. You’re upset. We’re upset. Clearly we both are not in a productive space. Let’s take a pause for five minutes to rebaseline a bit, and then let’s continue the discussion. I know we can find a way through here. We have to”This is the key point, where we decided to not only get our wits about ourselves but to also provide some space to the other person in the situationWe also acknowledged both sides of the situation We also controlled the pace of the conversation and entered a break on a positive noteWe take 5-7 minutes…The Return happens, where now we can help direct the narrative We lay out the unfortunate situation and how it impacts both and propose a middle ground, appealing both to business logic and this person’s sense of decency. We state that we think this is fair, and that finding something near this middleground will prevent a far more costly issue from arising for both of us. We then give them time to process — “take some time to think this over. We’ll be here on mute.”Eventually the situation gets resolved. We did end up having to pay double what we had originally planned, which really, really sucked. But we were able to get our things moved that day. We remained adherent to our timeline. We found our way to arrive at a compromise that was just-barely satisfactory enough for both parties. But it was enough for us to get through it, and for both parties to acknowledge each other and apologize for heated words exchanged + to thank each other for having the patience to come to a resolution. Still, we had just depleted virtually all  of our savings to fund a down payment on our first home, and did not have much wiggle room left to move our life across the country. This situation pushed us to an extremely uncomfortable position in the near-term, but after it happened we gave ourselves even more space yet to process the situation, to reflect on how much worse it could’ve been, to appreciate the lesson learned, and most importantly to give ourselves some damned credit for handling a really crappy situation well (all things considered). Since then, whenever we get to and overcome a tough situation, we always say that “We’ve built character.” It’s a bit of a reward for persevering through something unpleasant… And while this might not be sufficient for some, it is something we value highly.The last night in Seattle, after our last drive through Magnolia, we reflected on our growth over a glass of red wine, which certainly helped smooth out a stressy day. We flew out the next morning, feeling financially depleted, but spiritually full.In moments of extreme stress, when you have the option of helping to slow down the pace of a situation, take it. You do need to be cognizant of taking too much time, because too much time spent in uncertainty can stress both parties out even more. One of my friends once told me, seemingly quoting some psychology course, that: “waiting is the worst state of being\"  I try to remember this whenever you’re about to suggest a slow-down of a situation. The way I’ve mitigated this in the past is to clearly explain the purpose of taking a time-out. Notice in the situation above that we explained why we were taking a break, and offered an indication that a resolution was on the horizon…that this unpleasant scenario could come to an end. By doing this, we were trying to provide a sense of relief to the other party, to grant them more space to focus on a solution (as opposed to more reasons to screw us over even more). I wanted the last thing that guy thought about before he was in his own head for five minutes was my optimistic message. Let that reverberate; not ill wishes.Is the above too abstract? Not specific enough? Let’s go a level deeper to help you feel confident when managing the clock. Take Deep Breaths often during conversations. When someone is waiting for you to respond, it’s okay to take a big deep breatheGive very clear indications that you are thinking. My colleagues hear me say, “i’m processing….” “I’m thinking…” frequently. Suggest that everyone involved take some thinking time. If you’re in my organization at work, you have probably gotten used to me saying things like, “Alright, now take three minutes, write down your thoughts, and then we’ll continue…” — this is me trying to slow down time, to give you all space to think :)  …This also works in challenging situations. “OK, everyone here is clearly upset. Nothing’s going to take away what was said. Let’s each take 5 minutes to go take a walk, and then when we come back, we’re going to spend some time writing down our thoughts on the optimal path forward for all parties” === something along the lines of what I told my team as we sat in the office at 11pm in the middle of a Philly snowstormThink about professional sports teams, who oftentimes — especially near the end of a game — will “manage the clock” to minimize time for the other side to come back. That is NOT what I’m suggesting you use clock management for at work, but I can certainly appreciate when LeBron hangs out in the backcourt, assessing the situation ahead of him, carefully managing his energy, and finding extra space to process how to get the jamIn this video, notice how much time LeBron is hanging out in the backcourt area before making his final push to the rimHope you all have a wonderful month ahead!MichaelShare this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 016 (Weekend Edition): Slowing Down Time to Create Space During Difficult ConversationsCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I recognize this may seem impossible for some. For me, it has been one of the most critical enablers of my rejuvenation —> ability to live in the present & show up with energy at work. (and yes, there are times when one can’t do this…when you need to work on weekends, nights, etc. I get that. I do it sometimes, but challenge yourself here: should your default be always-on connectivity?I asked myself this question a long time ago after realizing that after very long days at work, I would sit on my phone for hours scrolling Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and (insert your go-to platforms). Then, on the weekends, I would end up doing the same thing, Friday, Saturday, Sunday… Sometimes I would look up and ask, “where the hell did the last two hours go” or “why do I suddenly feel like shit?” I felt stressed enough already; my electronics shouldn’t be making that worse. I finally decided to make a change when my habit of scrolling social media / news at night started messing up my sleep quality. After weeks of sub-optimal sleep, I started experimenting with a variety of small changes, which I’ll outline below. Here’s how I try to practice healthy habits around electronics + here’s how I manage expectations with anyone needing to get in contact. I delete any work related applications from my phone on weekends At night or on weekends, I physically put my phone in a drawer on silent. And if I’m out and about, I will typically put it somewhere that I cannot see itWhen my fiance is willing to do so, I’ll actually leave my phone off / at home just in case someone needs to get in touch with us for an emergencyMy work teams know that I will not respond to their pings / emails after a certain point, and to text me if it’s truly an emergencyI only spend 30 minutes on social media week max. Yes, this is tough because I feel disconnected from so much of what is happening in my friends’ lives sometimes. But I’ve embraced 1-1 communication via text / phone as a way to have quality catch-upsLike Tim Ferris, I limit news intake. I strive to be informed on key world events, and I certainly pick times to dive very deep into a topic, but I am not one to spend hours reading the newsI am oftentimes slow to respond. If we speak regularly, you’ve undoubtedly experienced me taking days to respond (shit I know I have at least a few messages from the last 3 days that I’m behind on). My close friends know that this is not me intentionally snubbing them; it’s me managing energy…not feeling like I’m in control by my phone. I respond to messages when I have the time to do so intentionally OR I will be direct and say something like, “FYI saw this. Super in the zone today at work! Will respond ASAP”I have found that people tend to really respect this as long as you take extra micro-seconds to be warmer / more kind than you think is necessary via text (where it’s very hard to discern tone)I try to redirect my nervous “i’m not connected” energy to things like reading, playing games, physical fitness, exploring the city / world and trying to relish whatever I’m doing right now. A favorite reminder I have for myself is to say, “Look Up” — and I will physically look up around me, noticing what’s happening in the environment around me, and finding peace and/or intellectual stimulation in observationA reminder: “tactics” don’t work the same for everyone. What I do likely wouldn’t work very well for many folks reading this, but I have lately been encountering more people who have some of the same habits as I do, and they also seem to be getting great value from them. 2Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 015 - Tactics: Getting Rid of Your Phone on Nights & WeekendsCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

It’s a bit personal and talks a bunch about my family and business.Last year, we moved from Seattle to Atlanta. The move was certainly motivated a bit by the desire to be closer to family, but it was also motivated by the incredible evolution of the city and its rapidly-growing startup ecosystem. We’ve seen something really remarkable developments happening here (many people moving to / back to the area; incredible development of the food scene, more unicorn startups, etc.). But as I’ve driven through the city I called home for most of my childhood, I’ve also experienced countless moments where my heart feels a wild mix of emotions — the feeling of failure, the sweet satisfaction of triumph, anger, joy, the pure fun of coming up with a way to grow part of a business. It’s all there. Many of these emotions have come from having a front-row seat to watching my family (not just my Dad! — this was a team effort) build a business from scratch, with no outside funding, as an African American in the Southeast…a business that still grows to this day, and still employs a bunch of great people while treating them with deep respect and appreciation (they have something like a 98% retention rate over the last decade…). We’re approaching the 21st anniversary of the company, so I thought I would write down some of the biggest lessons I’ve learned from watching my family build something that has outlasted virtually all of its competition. While my career has taken me more into consulting + tech startups than manufacturing services, it’s still an inextricable part of our family, and I am beyond grateful for the character and lessons earned throughout the last 21 years.Here is a list of ten things I learned from watching my family build a tech-oriented, manufacturing services business. More detail is below, after the break If you have a family while building a business, you need to make sure they understand the Why behind your journey, and how it might impact them (and be prepared for it to be challenging)Obsess over your early customers’ value derived from your services Build deep relationships with your customers Practice kindness at all times, and always do right by othersIndex the markets you’re playing in, have a deep understanding of your competitors, be focused when you go to market Justify Every Cost, Embrace Scrappiness, Do Not Skimp on Employee Compensation“Betting the company” is not a strategy that most people should employHave a 5-10 year vision, and a longer-term set of aspirations beyond thatPoint That Has Worked…That I Disagree With: Err towards doing things in-house versus outsourcingMeticulously Personalize Your Sales Motion (for high-value prospects)Before I go into more detail below, I wanted to share this picture of my Dad, his father (Eugene), and I on one of our first vacations after the company had started turning around after a rough couple of years. It was (I think) the first time my Father had been able to pay for a vacation for his Dad, and we decided to celebrate in style (…yes, my glasses have a blue tint — … it was “a style choice” as my fiance might say!). The journey from zero to (whatever you’re targeting) is challenging, and it’s important to celebrate when you hit milestones. My grandfather passed away not too long after this picture was taken, but I think he knew his son would build something special. Likely photo credit to my Mom (who, yes, also worked for the family business for a very long time!).If you have a family while building a business, you need to make sure they understand the Why behind your journey, and how it might impact themI watched two parents be very eyes-wide-open to how difficult the journey would be, and they were straightforward with me about the types of sacrifices we would have to make. It was harder than I think any of us imagined it would be, but also incredibly rewardingTactic: they involved me in many aspects of building the business, so that I felt like I was part of the journey too (and over time, I did my part to help!). This helped reduce the distance that a kid can feel from this all-consuming thing a parent is doing. My parents did a lot of this. I grew up spending late nights in commercial banks and hanging out in my Dad’s office before he left corporate america / F500 land in 2001Reminder: Watch your health at all times. My Dad, after a particularly rough few years, got into a brutally consistent fitness habit that he has sustained for essentially 16 straight years at this point — multiple spin classes, walking at a local park / mountain, deep relaxation timeKnow that this journey will impact your kids in ways you can’t predict — going to be totally raw here:When you grow up with a successful founder in the family, it puts ENORMOUS pressure on you to try to “live up to” what they did. It probably took until I was 30 years old to actually process this in a healthy way. Over time, you learn how to have your own dreams and your own bars for yourselfThe stress of building a company oftentimes spills over into your home life, and in our case I saw many … “debates” over business strategy - some totally cool + logical, others very heated. Our nightly dinners usually featured a discussion about some business topic — I joke about it now with colleagues, but it got to be exhausting at times! Which leads me to the next point…Work never stops when you’re building. When we went on vacation, we talked about work. When we were taking walks in the park, we talked about work. When we went to see a play, we marveled at the backdrop, and then thought about work. When I went to college and called my parents, we talked about work. And when I got my first job in consulting and called my parents after work, we would first talk about the consulting firm, and then we would talk about the company.There was an unyielding obsession with building & getting it right, because if we didn’t get it right, there was no multi-generational wealth safety net. Savings were gone. It had to work. And particularly as African Americans / Cubans we knew that winning for us would help us play a more powerful role in helping to support more entrepreneurs of color (in particular)For context, it was virtually impossible for our family business to get funded. They tried, but they were turned down over and over and over and over, and in many cases treated with pure disrespect. The end result was pretty enormous risk-taking for my family — basically betting our life savings on the companyWhich leads into some points about how to “make it work” …Obsess over your early customers’ value derived from your services Everything at the company was/is value oriented. Every single interaction has to be valuable, and every single thread of the business is always getting better.By obsessing over what your first (or first two) customers need, you end up creating hyper-tailored offerings for them —> allows you to build a consistent / repeatable revenue base —> allows you to start layering other offerings into the mixDo not take your core customers for granted. If you do that, they will leave you. Our business has placed huge emphasis on gaining the adoration and trust of customers, over and over again, through every interaction, whether it’s an unscheduled Friday afternoon phone call, or a multi-hour negotiation meeting surrounding a business opportunityBuild deep relationships with your customers If you don’t have a personal connection with your customers, they’re going to have less affinity for you. Lower affinity —> lower barrier to exit (the business relationship)We have always gone above and beyond to know the people we worked with, and many of these people are still close family friends 20 years laterIn the high tech space, this oftentimes looks like a Customer Advisory Board (CAB) or Design Partner Program (DPP) — the customers who are willing to stick with you while you’re still in the core building of your offerings I say “offerings” a lot, this just means: products, services /  experience. So, “Offering Design” = the design of a product / service / experiencePractice kindness at all times, and always do right by othersBeing kind / warm to others is important because: (1) it feels great to make others feel great (at least that’s my view), and (2) in business, people remember how they felt around you likely more than they’ll remember whatever you’ve spoken about over timeScrewing over competitors or partners in order to make more $$$ is a shitty way to behave, and it’s an even shittier way to do business. You can needlessly create enemies, and all it takes is a collection of enemies getting on the same team to make it really hard for you to move forward / do business The business has embraced partnering with other organizations as a way to create win-win scenarios. “One should always strive to be fair” is a quote I wrote down from my Dad a while agoIndex the markets you’re playing in, have a deep understanding of your competitors, be focused when you go to market To win repeatedly in markets, you absolutely must know who is playing in them and what technologies could disrupt the way a market is organized. Know Your Market = know all of the major players, the medium-sized players, the smaller / newer entrants. Understand their value proposition, know their values, get insight into how they sell, how they price their offerings, get feedback on them from potential buyers. And do this constantly. This market visibility is ultimately how you can make more informed strategic choicesUse this visibility to have very services that are hyper-tailored to the buyers in your market space. Nothing should feel genericKnow Tech Trends = the business I’ve been discussing is largely focused in the manufacturing services and operations industry, and we’ve kept tightly up to date on things like 3D printing, Internet of Things, robotics, and process automation very closely, because each of these technology areas has impacts on the fundamentals of our business. By studying it closely, we are more likely to take advantage of new trends than we are to be a victim of the disruption they causeJustify Every Cost, Embrace Scrappiness, Do Not Skimp on Employee CompensationJustify Every Cost = while my family didn’t explicitly do ZBB (zero-based budgeting, a practice whereby a business must, line-by-line, justify every cost incurred as a means of ensuring maximum cost control + spare resources to invest in higher-output/higher-margin activities), we did approach the business with a ZBB-esque mindset. We stayed in decent hotels, but not super nice hotels; we had enjoyable meals, but we weren’t doing Michelin star dining haha; employees — including executive officers — were paid reasonable salaries + had long-term incentives in place to align their behaviors with target outcomes of the businessEmbrace Scrappiness = innovation is often born out of limitation. For example, there were plenty of times where a larger competitor had a mammoth marketing budget (we never did), and we would find ways to out-hustle them at conferences. Our trade show booth (which I proudly manned for many years!) was nice, but the time we saved in breaking it down at the end of the afternoon was more time we spent at happy hour with potential customersDon’t Skimp on Employee Compensation. I actually pressed delete here because what I was writing was too watered down. I’ll say it this way: pay employees more than market, even if (and it usually does) mean taking less executive compensation. One of the things I am most proud of our family business for is paying WELL above market, and actually saying NO to projects that don’t allow the company to continue making a reasonable profit + pay employees very well. This IS the strategy if you want to keep people for a long time (some businesses, like Netflix, have a model that’s more akin to tours of duty; this was not our approach)In the early years when there basically was no income (read that again, imagine having a family with medical costs / costs from raising two kids, your savings are completely depleted, and you know it will likely be this way for years), it was easy to almost fantasize about the days when you would have income againAt the point when things started to take a bit of a turn, it would have been enormously easy to just take as many of the profits as possible, but that is not what company leadership did. They carved out a very sizable portion of the profits from that year and immediately distributed it to the employees, and then they kept doing it…and kept doing it…and kept doing it, and still do it. Which makes recruiting the best people in the segment wayyyy easier. The best people in the segment want to go work at this company“Betting the company” is not a strategy that most people should employAs I’ve read through countless business books / articles / podcasts, I’ve oftentimes come across cases where businesses made MASSIVE bets to grab parts of a market, bets that could kill the company if they failedBusiness press loves to glorify the entrepreneur who bet the company (I know a couple who did this successfully!). We are mostly hearing about the cases where it worked, but most of the time this does not work.Betting the company can take your company out of the game…when half of winning is showing upMost great companies are not built in 3 or 4 years (which might seem counter to much of the news I read). It usually takes 5, 10+ years to build something great. During that time, most entrepreneurs will have opportunities to make really bold plays to quickly ascend up a market’s pecking order. There are times when this is the optimal move, but we’ve found that in most small/medium-sized businesses (read: not companies trying to fully own a global category, like many venture-backed companies), it’s probably better to be more measured and avoid the temptation of get rich quick schemes. For our business, this was taking on risky international projects in geographies we had not been to ourselves and where we did not have a deep appreciation for the local way of doing business (including contending with local regulations)Have a 5-10 year vision, and a longer-term set of aspirations beyond thatThe reason I went into the industry of defining multi-year strategies was probably because I saw my Dad do this over and over again, every year iterating on the multi-year arc that the company would take. I saw the power in thinking ahead of where most people are, and in going so far as to draw out exactly how you think a game might evolve — literally drawing out charts and timelines with different scenarios and plotting key potential actions on these timelines, and thinking through — “If company Y exits this market because they can’t make enough margin, how will that impact us when they would be likely to pull out, say in June?”But at some point, you need long-term aspirations that guide your choices today. In our case, there has always been a 10-20 year vision (albeit loosely defined…) as to where the company COULD go, and that helped to prioritize where we would NOT focus our energy in the near termThis ability to NOT focus on certain things helped keep the company focused on the activities and pursuits that could deliver the best-possible outcomes only. In the words of my Dad, “be careful chasing shiny objects.”Point That Has Worked…That I Disagree With: Err towards doing things in-house versus outsourcingI stronglyyyyy disagree with this approach, but I appreciate that the business has grown largely by totally avoiding the will to outsource certain functions. I am fairly certain that the company has never spent a single dollar on a marketing or advertising agency (for example), preferring instead to embrace peer-to-peer marketing via 1-1 relationship development and very consistent participation in a set of select trade shows + other ecosystem partnership playsThe reasoning for this has largely been cost management oriented + having concerns over how IP could be stolen — two things the business has always been hyper focused on — but I do think it’s challenging to build sustainable businesses by doing everything in houseClearly I’ve been wrong here (for this particular business)Meticulously Personalize Your Sales Motion (for high-value prospects)Sales makes or breaks a business When there is a high-value opportunity to pitch offerings, you should create a direct connection between the problems a customer is trying to solve for and exactly how your offerings are uniquely suited to solve said problemsIt was in the early days of business building that I learned some of my research habits that now underpin much of how I operate in a sales context (things I’ve mentioned in prior articles, specifically Letter 002) Role play how a key meeting will go…if not with yourself, then with a colleague who has sufficient understanding of the context.Example: “OK, what if they say we’re too expensive? How do we handle that objection?” ——> (insert crisp bullet points about the value they need to see, how our higher price is more than offset by other factors, and how the quality of our outputs are unmatched + how our track record is utterly superior to any other company they could be talking to)Consider that it’s taken 20+ years to build the business, these ten points barely scratch the surface of how it was done… However, they do encapsulate a bunch of what I’ve been reflecting on lately, as I’ve driven past places I haven’t seen in 15 years, sat in the same home we moved to back in 1997, and watched my parents continue to live the family business every day. To have built a lasting industrials business as a minority in the Southeast is a wonderful accomplishment; it’s rare… And it’s virtually impossible to find another case where someone in this position has remained on such strong footing with their customers for so long. In fact, most of the competitors we played against back in 2002 are out of business. I think some of the points above give insight into why this company is still here, still growing, still creating value, while many other businesses failed (see point #2 about kindness and point #7 about “get rich quick” schemes — failure to heed those two points in particular has rendered at least three key competitors finished).Back to my above point about having your own dreams and setting your own bar… I long ago came to the conclusion that to try and fully separate from this was futile. The experience of building is a fundamental part of my identify — who I am, and so instead of trying to blunt it, I’ve welcomed its influence.Keep on keepin’ on, Dad + thank you, Mom, for also playing such a big role in the journey. You two are heroes, and I get my intensity from you both :) (my parents love to comment these days on how “intense” I am haha).I have exciting news to share: You can now read Exonomist by Michael Davis in the new Substack app for iPhone.Read Exonomist by Michael Davis in the Substack appAvailable for iOS and AndroidGet the appWith the app, you’ll have a dedicated Inbox for my Substack and any others you subscribe to.

What can we do about it?Michael DavisMar 10, 20221Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 013 - Executive Whiplash Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareExecutive Whiplash: the phenomenon whereby an individual, team, or organization is “whipped” back and forth by constantly changing direction from their management layer. Akin to the feeling you get when being lashed back and forth on a rollercoaster. Likely cause of many late-night working sessions.Source: My BrainA couple of years ago, I was on a project where we had to report to three bosses (at the same level). Each of these bosses was extremely busy… So busy that it felt miraculous to get them on one phone call at the same time. I should’ve known from the moment my direct manager said, “oh, and we have three partners on this project” that I would be entering….Week after week, we would spend two days working on an analysis or presentation, and get into the following, awful cycle. Monday: A review with Boss 1, who tells us, “The plan should incorporate the 25-34 age demographic” and then Tuesday PM: A review with Boss 2 who aggressively says, “I looked at the plan, and why have we added back in the 25-34 age demographic? I thought I told you to isolate out that slice from the plan?” Tuesday PM: UGH!Wednesday: And then a review with Boss 3 would say, “Ask Boss 1 and Boss 2 what they think”…. and thenFriday: It’s Friday at 3pm and we finally get them all onto one call. They talk it out, and we have a plan in place: we are going to incorporate the 25-34 age demographic after all… Following Monday: Boss 3, who was multitasking on our Friday call, says those most-feared words: “wait….team, um: Why are we including the 25-34 age…”Years ago, after many a week like the one I described above, I started writing out how to avoid the pain of whiplash. I wrote out a massive list that included things like: Get all key stakeholders in the room on a regular basis, have a log of key decisions and questions and physically document the group’s decision on a slide that you will review at every meeting Ensure the rationale for key decisions is known, and communicated in an update e-mail / message to all relevant team members Spend time at the beginning of a project being extremely clear (in written form) about scope, questions to be answered by an analysis, outcomes to be generated by work, metrics that will help you understand if you’re making progress throughout the project itselfGive people feedback when direction is changing too much by simply saying something like, “hey, we spent a decent amount of time putting this together. I’m OK if we want to move in a different direction, but I want to be sure before we throw away this work”Etc. etc.But as time goes on, my mind has started to shift towards accepting whiplash as part of work. Maybe that’s a cop-out, but hear me out: As we spend more time around a problem, we tend to learn more about it, and that increased learning might tell us that our past approach was sub-optimal Example: On day 1 of vacation, I planned to go sit at the beach for four days straight reading books. But by day 3, sunburn started to set in, and a seagull just pooped in my rum and coke (…this actually happened to me in Mexico one time). After this shitty occurrence, I decide to pivot and go to an art gallery Evolving your point of view is a good thing, especially when that evolution is going to help you achieve your goal A great leader will constantly give opportunities for disagreement, and in fact try to tease it out. On the age demographic example above, I wished one of the bosses would’ve pushed me to give reasons counter to their view. They asked if we agreed, sure, but we really knew that if we disagreed it would be met with frustration.Very simple tactic to avoid this, leaders: simply talk out the pros and cons! “What are the pros of going in this direction? What are the cons? Can we reverse course easily if we later want to change our minds?”If whiplash is a part of work, how can we make it feel less shitty? Here’s what I’ve learned from seeing great leaders handle it:Constantly Reinforce the Broader Context — People like to know why they’re experiencing inconsistency or discomfort. It helps them to rationalize whatever they are experiencing. A great example is something like, “Our competitive landscape is more packed than it has ever been and we are rapidly losing marketshare. If we hope to remain relevant or market-leading, we have to make some big pivots now.” Manage Expectations With Your Team — Describe what the team might feel or experience throughout a journey. Great example from one of my mentors went something like this: “Team, we know the timeline here is aggressive, and we fought hard to give us all more time, but it simply couldn’t happen this time because ____. We’re going to feel tired at times, we’re going to feel frustrated, and that’s OK because we’re a team. And we have each other’s backs. Now, let’s start laying out some ground rules for how we can make this as smooth as possible…”Be Clear About What You Do and Do Not Know — Most of us are not the final decision maker, and most teams are not going to be in the room where choices are made. And even if you were in the room, you are unlikely to ever have the full picture about why a decision was made. It is important to be transparent about thisExample from my soccer team growing up — “Look team, we are missing two of our key players here. We haven’t practiced with some of you in the positions you’ll fill today, and we don’t know how it will work out.  … But what we Do know is that we have a strong command of the fundamentals. We pass the ball well. We have more stamina than the other team, and we have more heart — DAMNIT, We Have. More. Heart!” (OK, I made up the “we have more heart” part, because I want my childhood sports memories to be excessively dramatized, like Matt Damon moving in slow motion in the moving Invictus — was an hour of that movie in slow motion? I think so.)Adjust Workload to Have More Wiggle Room — If you know your team is going to be overwhelmed, just get ahead of the problem and start streamlining focus… Start removing things that are not absolutely critical, bring more people on board, help make some part of their process more efficient / less time consuming… Give Your Team A Voice — Many of us our fortunate enough to work with very very smart, capable people who have the experience and creativity to solve problems. Make sure their voices are heard, make sure they KNOW their voices are being heard… Few things are more demoralizing than feeling like your voice doesn’t matter.Respond to feedback directly Positively reinforce people who provide ideas or ways to improve somethingRespect when someone gives a dissenting opinion + make sure you’re connecting with your team enough so as to not be totally blindsided in, say, a large meeting where social dynamics can make dissent more uncomfortable If you work in an organization where dissent is not valued, that is likely a leadership problem… Leadership creates environment in which we all work.Updated from Beth R. (this woman changed my life), “You forgot to add: Laugh about the whiplash when it inevitably happens’”Sage wisdom :)In this world where markets move faster than they ever have (meaning new entrants are constantly emerging, product development lifecycles are faster than ever), we have to expect that the new norm is rapid change at work. If this is true, then instead of lamenting the pace of change, we need to find ways to contend with and take advantage of it.

If you missed the last several reads, here are some: Letter 011 - “I need for you to see the fucking bigger picture”Letter 010 - “Your calendar is your battlefield & other thoughts on strong prioritizationLetter 008 - “Tactics for running kick-ass projects (and reflections on a failure I had)”*Written very early in the morning recently, after having a kinda rough day*It’s 7pm in Manhattan, sometime in Spring of 2016. My roommate (and lifelong friend, Mo) and I are catching up after long days at both of our consulting firms and he drops this term that has stuck with me ever since: “re-baselining.” We were talking about how someone gets back to a (healthy) baseline after disruption at work. In this case, the scenario was: Holy shit the last three weeks have been insane. Nonstop work. You wake up at 6:30am stressed out and you’re on your computer grinding nonstop until way-too-late in the evening or early morningThis leads to burnout, and in a state of burnout it’s hard/impossible to be productive (or hell, strategic)A really badass leader will help you and your team re-baseline so that people can recover and you can get back to being productiveI ended up taking this situation and applying it to a more micro level: to the individual. To myself. Fast forward a year, and I’m having an absolute burner of a week. I am extremely stressed out, I’ve had too much caffeine, I feel like I want to cry because I haven’t been sleeping enough, my calendar looks like a messed up Tetris board, I’m arguing with my then-partner outside of work, and overall I feel like I’m reaching the point where I wonder: “Can I do this? Can I make it through this week? Psht, can I even make it through today?”Yes. Hell yes. You absolutely can. Here are some ways I’ve learned to re-baseline amidst particularly rough times at work. Here’s my summarized pattern: 1 | Create Space2 | Jolt the System3 | Take Control4 | Plan for Rejuvenation (and make it happen!)ONE - Create Space: Look at your calendar. Move things that are not critical to another day to give yourself some space back for GTD (get thinking done) or GSD (get shit done).Review upcoming deadlines or commitments you have and try to get them extended.When you propose an extension, do not apologize for it. Simply state that to get the quality outcome you’re going for, and that more time is needed (oh man this is likely going to be another newsletter topic — pushing back / adjusting timelines)Meditate and/or do deep breathing for at least 3 minutesMy favorite exercise is to breath in for 6 seconds, hold it for 6-8 seconds, breath out for 8 seconds over and over again until you feel some physical reliefVisualize the Extremes — this is my favorite tactic to re-baseline at any time, period. I take 60 seconds to imagine the worst possible scenario I could be experiencing right now, and then I imagine the absolute best possible scenario, and then I try to pinpoint where I am along that spectrum. In most cases, you will realize that things could be wayyyyy worse than they are right now. Once you’ve done this, take some time to think about 3-4 things you are thankful for. Visualization is important here. Simply writing down, “i’m thankful for my spouse” is not enough — visualize that person, the times you’ve had together, and what you’ve achieved togetherGive yourself some grace. We do the best we can every day, and credit is due for what you have done. The next time you see, “shit, I’m 30% behind my goal of 100%”, take some time to appreciate (and communicate) what has gotten you to 70%. This is a big aspect of OKRs and keeping environments psychologically safe… And a note for managers: you need to do the same for your employees. Call out what they have accomplished, how they have showed up. Give credit, show gratitude, coach them on how to make strengths even stronger… especially while you’re giving critical feedback. If you don’t do this, you risk sending your employees on an emotional spiral that will impact their morale and their ability to perform consistently over timeTWO - Jolt the System: Tactic 1: Do a very high-intensity workout; it can be shortTactic 2: Take a cold shower, or at least do a cold water blast amidst a hot shower(Maybe Weird) Tactic 3: Primal scream (hey, it doesn’t work for everyone, but sometimes it feels really good to just get a big yell out in the car)Tactic 4: Listen to music that pumps you upTactic 5: Talk to a friend who will help you get back on track — sometimes this is someone who will just listen to you, sometimes it’s someone who will give you the proverbial smack in the face and tell you to “get it together! You’ve got this!”Tactic 6: Ensure your nutrition game is on point. For me, these are my daily green shakes. For many folks, this is coffee / teaBut beware having too much caffeine — there is a wide body of research around the effects of caffeine intake over time. I am not a doctor, do not take this as medical advice… You have to do what works for you, but too much caffeine can be a recipe for higher stressTactic 7: “Will what I’m contending with right now matter in a year?” is a great question to ask yourself. I got this from one of my favorite books, Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff, and It’s All Small StuffTHREE - Take Control: Ideally by now you have calmed down a little bit, you’ve forced yourself to get some perspective, you’ve created some space in your schedule, and you’ve jolted your system. Now it’s time to take control… That is, to focus on what you CAN control and to move with speed on accomplishing what you canThink about everything you have accomplished in your life. Think about all of the difficult things you have gotten through. And remember that you will get through this, too. That you’re going to look back on this moment in a year, and you will have gotten through itRe-do your to do list and highlight three things you can do, and make sure there are some quick-to-accomplish tasks in there. This will help you build momentum. I use Notion for task tracking and have for years. It is my Life Operating System in a way, and I constantly re-build my to do list to ensure focus is kept on the most critical + high impact thingsFOUR - Plan for Rejuvenation (and make it happen!)Celebrating is one of the most important things you can do. Psychologically, it is so important to have points where you know you will get a breather.Celebrate when you have made it through a challenging day / week, and take some time to think through how you did it. Revel in the growth you’ve made happen, and how it will serve you going forwardSchedule time to GND/Chill if that’s what you need to make sure you get that time on a regular basisMake sure you have time set aside to relax — truly relax…Sitting and doing something that requires minimal physical load from you. My Oura ring purchase has been SUPER helpful for this (no, I am not getting paid to drop products; I just genuinely love this device)To the extent possible, make sure you take a day (or more) off from work regularly to recharge. I try to take at least one Friday per month to handle personal life things + have a bit of a longer weekendIf your recharge time gets disrupted, track why/how it got disrupted and try to think through what you need to do to decrease the chance of the disruption happening again. And then make sure to re-allocate that time somewhere else. Example: If you have an excessively late night / early morning, make sure you stop work earlier or start work later for at least one of the upcoming days to sort of rebalanceClosing ThoughtsAbove is how I re-baseline. It doesn’t always work, but I’ve found the tactics and reminders above to be truly essential to keeping me happy+healthy+productive on the work front, especially with the pressure of many different threads at work.I think re-baselining effectively is a key part of a healthy relationship with your job. This is especially important while you are taking on more responsibility or new projects and the learning curve + ambiguity of the situation may take more energy to contend with.1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 012 - How to Re-Baseline & Take Control While Having a Rough Day/WeekCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

He was exasperated. I wanted to help him, but I just didn’t know how to at that point (I was also afraid to speak too much while he was still so exhausted and tender from the pressure he had just dealt with).In that moment, I thought back to a concept I had learned from one of my mentors about “leveling up” your point of view. Getting to a higher altitude. Here’s an example of how “leveling up” works, written as a progression of events: Event 1: We have a sales problem. We can’t convert our salesEvent 2: The problem is that our sales people aren’t trained to effectively sell the productEvent 3: You realize that your sales force is actually well trained, capable, and enabled. Event 4: “Crap, I’m stuck” This is when you level upEvent 5: Let’s level up our thinking. Instead of thinking about the team, let’s think about the department in which this team seats. And then let’s think about the company in which the department sits. And then let’s think about the segment in which the company sits. And then let’s think about the overall market in which the company sits, and then let’s think about the broader economy and macro trends that might be impacting all of the factors belowAt each level, you’re tracking what’s happening, what people are striving for, the challenges they’re facing, and also considering how they behave / moveBy going through this leveling up exercise over and over again, you will force yourself to think at a higher level and appreciate how different “levels” of your organization and the world within which it operates are differentThis is one of the single hardest things for people to do, especially when they are growing into leaders who have to think more strategically. Being “strategic” is just carefully applying an understanding of many different factors to a situation, in a way that is hopefully novel and ideally effective. OK, so if the above example wasn’t enough, here are more ways to level up your thinking. The next time you hear someone say something…anything, ask: “What is the broader context within which this comment is being made?”Personal example: If someone is upset about something, ask why they’re upset. Visualize their context, try to imagine the day they’ve had, and try to consider all of the factors they’re contending with in their lifeWork Example: If someone says, “we just need to execute” and you don’t fully understand how to do that, or you need to find a way to do it creatively, think about what the strategy of the team is, what the strategy of the division is, what the priorities of the company areThe next time you’re working on anything at work, think about all of the factors outside of your direct sphere of control that could impact the work and its ability to drive results/outcomes. Example: you’re building out a report for your boss. You could just do the report and send it in, or…You could think about why the hell you’re doing this report in the first place. Big theme of my writing is alignment to some bigger goal. So how does the work align to the goals of your boss, their boss, etc.You could think about what external factors are impacting the work (dependencies? Marketing? Sales? Ops? Product? Engineering? Competition (what are your competitors doing?)? etc. etc.)You could think about where this work should go — who else would benefit from seeing this?Bonus tactic: You could think about how this report could be 10% better than the last one you submittedLet’s return to the story I shared above, and what the executive really wanted when she wanted her colleague to see the bigger picture. She wanted him to think bigger! She was waiting for him to say “we’re going to create an entirely new suite of offerings to address a use case our product hadn’t yet been applied to, but that our customers were asking for” instead of, “I think we need to be more efficient with our resources” (how work is assigned to various team members). It can be extremely energizing to get outside of your immediate context — what you see in front of and around you — and to look up, and to imagine what it’s like to see your situation from a different level…almost visualizing your situation as if you were watching a performance in a theater, seated in the front row.And then imagining how much more of the stage and theater you’d see by sitting a little further back, and a little further back, and a little further up… Practice thinking at a higher altitude, and you’ll be able to see more nuance and complexity around you, and you just might start to make sense of it.3Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 011 - \"I need for you to see the fucking bigger picture\"Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

After a particularly long day, I’m left to ask myself: “why am I still online?” It’s both an outcome of a genuinely busy time and my failure to adequately prioritize my time over the last couple of weeks (gotta call it like I se it). Therefore, I’m writing this letter to re-anchor to some ideas around prioritization that I think are important. Below is a view of: A formula for ImpactTreating your calendar like a battlefieldStrong prioritization / Prioritize With StrengthThink back over the last two weeks. Do you feel like you have worked on the things that are most important? How many times have you looked up after several hours of “work” only to realize you don’t have much to show for those last several hours. Not a great feeling. While I once had immense patience for this, that’s not the case anymore. I value my time (and the time of others) greatly... Because time is something that is relentless — it never stops moving forward, and I want to make sure I’m spending it in a way that I feel good about at the end of a day/week/month/year/decade/life. And hell, maybe that 30 minutes I just wasted could have been spent doing something nourishing — calling a family member, resting, dancing around like a jackass with our dog Tycho, pretending to not watch the latest season of “Love Is Blind” …. But getting to that state of “feeling good about how I’ve spent my time” is not easy task. In fact, taking control of your time means being aggressive about time management. This has been a recurring theme of my writing so far, because if you manage time effectively, you create space, and space is where you unlock flow state and quality thinking ====> this is what enables Impact. The attainment of a big move towards a goal. Allow me to create a totally unnecessary, completely mathematically sound formula to bottom-line this a bit more: Impact = Time (to think) + Energy (to do) + Focus (on what matters most).(read that in a Yoda voice)I’m going to focus on Time (to think) and Energy (what to do and not do) in the below sections.Big Idea 1: The Secret to Time Management is Treating Your Calendar Like A Battlefield. As your responsibilities grow and grow and grow, so too does the number of meetings you’ll be asked to attend. I remember a time early in my career where I had an ungodly amount of work, but a relatively light meeting load. In that scenario, my impact was dependent upon my ability to use my time wisely to complete various modules of an overarching task. I had more of a “maker” schedule than a manager schedule. In that scenario, I found it critical to plan out the “milestones” i’d hit throughout a day or week, lest I procrastinate and be forced to pull all-nighters to finish work (bleegghhhh I do not miss that). Admittedly, in this “maker” schedule, I didn’t have to be as vigilant on calendar management, but that all changed once I started managing complex projects with many work streams. If you experience that shift to more of a “manager” schedule, be prepared to aggressively implement guidelines in your calendar…Because if you don’t, you will undermine your ability to really drive excellent results. All of your time will disappear, and you’ll oftentimes look back and have not-enough to show for it. Here is how I structure my calendar to ensure consistent high-output. Create actual invites on your calendar to block certain activities, and make the invites recurring so that space is always there. I have my GSD (get shit done), GTD (get thinking done), and GND (get nothing done) meetings with myself every single day throughout the weekTheme your days to create some sense of consistency week-over-week (see my last issue for more on this) Do not attend a meeting unless you are critical or the information being disseminated is critical. I’m critical if my lack of attendance will lead to a breakdown in progress. Information is critical if me not hearing means I cannot effectively do my job and/or create the best environment possible for my colleaguesMake sure your recurring meetings have an end date. I typically set recurring invites for 1-2 quarters, so that I can regularly revisit if a recurring meeting is serving its purpose. Challenge people to share information asynchronously using tools like Loom and the beloved “memo” A great memo (shout out to my colleague Linsey!) follows a clear structure like: 2 bullets on Situation2 bullets on Problem2-5 bullets on Go-Forward Options2 bullets on suggested next steps and/or a clear call to action (CTA) like: “please respond to this message by selecting an above option and providing you thoughts ahead of our decision-making meeting next Tuesday”Challenge others to think carefully about meeting durations — do you really need 30 minutes? OK, maybe you do… But have a good reason for taking the time of others. I oftentimes do a “salary calculator” in my brain to estimate the cost of a meeting in people timeChallenge others to have a clearly stated Objective and/or agenda for the meeting, even if it is literally developed at the beginning of the meetingStrive to have a No/Low meeting day during the week. At Microsoft, this is Friday’s for us. This does mean the other four days of the week tend to be a little more crazy Ensure you have at least one day per month with absolutely no meetings whatsoever. This is when I’ll do “big think” activities or thinks like Press Pause summits (recently did this for channel strategy development — an area that I’m fairly knowledgeable on, but needed to go deeper on)Last (and definitely not least): set clear start and end times on your days. This is important for your sanity + personal space, but it’s also a really important part of working on global teams. We have colleagues that are all over the world, and the best way to make sure they aren’t having meetings booked at 11pm their time is to just block the hours off that you aren’t working. I’m based in Atlanta now, but most of my colleagues are in Seattle and India. This single tactic enabled the transition from West to East coast to go over fairly seamlessly… That and clear communications about my new “core working hours” There are so many other ways to protect your time, but much of how I protect mine comes down to the above. I don’t think anything above is particularly groundbreaking, but executing the above consistently is the key to calendar management. Big Idea 2: You Should Prioritize With Strength.Your calendar is simply a reflection of your priorities. I can analyze the time spent on different threads throughout the week and it’ll probably map to the prioritization of the different things I’m working on (it should!). Prioritization is what allows you to say Yes to what is most important, and No to what is not-critical or “off strategy.”I’ve spent thousands of hours in a “prioritization” context at work — for a couple of years, I felt like I was doing back-to-back-to-back “prioritization model” and “roadmap development” projects where all you did was choose the most high impact things to work on. I have a bunch of different models and frameworks I’ll share in other letters over time, but this is the one that I deploy on a daily/weekly basis to help me consistently prioritize my work and thus my calendar… to achieve Strong Prioritization.Here are the questions I ask myself when I am stack-ranking work at the beginning of every week. A. “If you could only do one thing each day of this week, what would you accomplish each day?”B. “Do your answers align with the priorities of your role/team/company?”C. “Do you have the ability to execute these priorities on your own? If not, who else needs to be involved? Do they have the time / will to assist?”D. “What happens if (activity) doesn’t get done by the end of the week?” (play out what will happen, and assess if it’s something that absolutely must be done this week)E. “If my competitors saw what I was going to accomplish this week, would my progress make them nervous?” (if is doesn’t, am I helping my company to increasingly put differentiating offerings out into market? Ultimately, everything I do should be contributing to the development of some competitive advantage for my company)F. “Does what I need to accomplish this week bring me energy / joy?” (if it doesn’t, then I should probably be re-evaluating the scope/focus of my job)G. When in doubt on any of your outputs, pressure test this with a colleague / your managerFinally, make sure to rank your priorities. No two things can be tied; your priorities must have a clear rank — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… This clarity is what drives the tough calls you make about what has to get done and what can be postponedIn summary, your calendar is a reflection of your priorities. Given that your priorities take so much of our time, it is a worthwhile exercise to question whether they are the right priorities.

I asked myself How such strong productivity was achieved, and wrote the below. This is a shorter read.The idea: assigning a theme to specific days of the week is a powerful way to increase your chance of flow state. Just like you might get to Saturday or Sunday and have excitement about something to occur on that day, I try to do the same thing Monday through Friday. It helps to provide some consistency and can help you strategically schedule meetings. Here’s how I’ve done it for the last few years (per usual, my corniness is going to be on full display). A note on mindset: I view my calendar as a battlefield. I am aggressive about protecting time to GSD (get shit done), and actively pull back from threads where I am not critical.Massive (or “Machine”) Monday - Start the week with big energy, immediately executing the plan I laid out last Friday. I tend to work longer hours on Monday’s, because it’s where the rest of the week’s actions are being laid out. Critically, I reserve 2 hours early every Monday morning for zero meetings + a moderate workout to get my body and mind into the right state to execute. Tactical Tuesday - This is usually when my very mentally intensive + strategically important meetings occur (at least the ones that couldn’t get scheduled for Monday). Additionally, I try to stack 1-1s on Tuesdays and Thursdays. These days I really try to schedule break times between meetings so I can make sure I’m acting on actions quickly + giving proper thought to whatever may have come up in 1-1s or other key meetings. Speaking of “key meetings”, if something is really a priority, it should get proper time and attention by EOD (end of day) Tuesday to make sure you have the runway of Weds, Thurs, and Fri to make things happenDeep Work Wednesday - I strive to have a weekly “workshop” where I make sure to accomplish any tasks that require deep focus to complete. This is usually when I’m doing things like: creating new offerings, modeling out capacity or growth dynamics for my teams, creating content, or thinking of how to scale a product or service. My calendar on Wednesday’s has to have uninterrupted blocks of time where I can dive deep. I finish off the day reviewing critical actions that were assigned on Monday/Tuesday to make sure we’re on track. Separately, this tends to be date night for Simi and I, because it’s important to break up the week!Variable Thursday - Worklife can be crazy. Every week is different, and I leave Thursdays more unstructured to be whatever I need for it to beForethought Friday - Increasingly Friday’s are No Meeting Fridays. I spend this time reviewing the week, closing out any loose ends, and closing my eyes + visualizing the next week, every single day of the next week… Key meetings coming up, meetings that need to be scheduled, conversations that need to be had, etc. Some additional thoughts: During particularly chaotic times, the days get shifted around. Maybe I have workshops or back-to-backs literally all day Wednesday. In that case, I’ll make sure Tuesday or Thursday have more Deep Work time built in 1-1s are the way organizations move forward (future post coming on this!). This is the way you stay tapped into the thoughts of your colleagues, create space for trust generation, and hear what is top of mind for the people around you. I’ve tried so many tactics for managing 1-1s, but what I’ve settled on is this: two days per week are focused on 1-1s, and I schedule them back-to-back, because my brain is in the motion of 1-1 conversation. When this can’t work, I’ll try to reserve 60-90 minutes per day for 1-1s and spread the throughout Monday - Thursday It’s best to revisit the themes of your days on a regular basis, because life+work are always changing around you The only way this works is if you get in the habit of looking ahead at your schedule 1-2 weeks in advance, day by day, and actively adjusting meeting times / recurring meetings before the other people’s calendars start getting locked up. Set aside time every week to do this (power tip from badass executive admins who oftentimes review the next 2 weeks of meetings with the executives they support).1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 009 - Theme your days to increase the chance of \"flow state\"Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I’ll be publishing an updated letter with the ideas you’ve shared (and will be citing them too of course)Letter 008:I’m pretty transparent about failures I’ve had. I think it’s important to talk about failures, if only to let the people around you know that you aren’t expected to be perfect…that shit happens, and you try your hardest to learn and grow from the experiences.Early in my career, after having kicked some serious ass on my first few projects (read: I was pompous and overconfident), I came across a project that I nearly ruined with my inability to manage it effectively. I failed. The words, “I can project manage” that I uttered rather arrogantly to a group of colleagues as I started the project haunted me for years. (I literally shuddered reading this #CringeAF).Let me be clear about failure: it means I was removed from a project about two months early. “The error you made nearly ruined our credibility with the client” + “we need A players, and you’re far from that” + “we’ve brought in a more experienced consultant to take over your workstreams” == some of the things I was told (months after losing a very close family member, so not the best headspace to be in).Everyone knew I was being removed. Everyone saw me walk out of our team room for the last time. Everyone knew when I went to our company happy hours. My next project knew. It felt absolutely awful, and the daily barrage of feedback (some delivered kindly, some rather brutal-bordering-on-cruel) I had received stuck with me. The experience destroyed my confidence and energy — it stuck with me emotionally for a long time. It took years of therapy + my own processing to come to truly come to terms with the failure (and, far more importantly, the family loss). But after that experience, I became a far stronger leader and eventually started garnering a reputation for running really fun, successful projects that beat expectations (it hasn’t all been smooth sailing, admittedly, but certainly better than the above setback I mentioned!). As I spoke this week with one of my awesome colleagues around running kick-ass projects, I decided to write out some tactics for project kickassery (of course Urban Dictionary has a definition for this…). This person + you all have other tactics/approaches you deploy for project success, and I’d love to hear them in the comments or as a reply —> so that we can all get better together. I’ll likely publish an update of this later with whatever tips you provide (with credit given!)For the new subscribers, a reminder that Exonomist is written quickly, in raw form, with minimal copy-editing, and the expectation that I’ll go back later and disagree with or refine what I’ve written previously.Running Kick-Ass Projects, A MemoDear Awesome Colleague, So you’ve decided to take on a role leading a big initiative — congratulations! You were chosen because you have demonstrated abilities getting results, and people love working with you. As you go into this project, I thought I’d bullet-point out some tactics & considerations to keep top of mind. This journey is going to be challenging and fun. Expect moments of discomfort and frustration, along with feelings of growth and victory. Here are some tactics to help you maximize your project’s chance of growth and success.Start with Why this project has to happen and What it will entail. How does this effort propel the organization forward? Why does it need to happen right now? What exactly are you going to do during the project, and how will you know it’s successful? Put your articulation of this onto a single page (word doc, slide, etc.) and share it with whoever is going to be sponsoring the project. Make sure you are 100% aligned. Do not try to speed through this step, walk the person line by line through this articulation, because misunderstanding here increases misunderstandings later. Oh, and did I say single page? Let me say it again: one page. The longer you drone on, the higher chance that people will get lost and miss your pointBuild momentum from the very first second of the project kick-off. I call this the “hot start” (been calling it that for years, not be confused with Andrew Chen’s The Cold Start Problem - great book btw). In this phase, you ensure that you’re ready to have an energizing kickoff meeting with every key stakeholder in the project. You need to be ready, in the right mental space to set the tone. Bring your authentic self, show your excitement, and remind people of the Why of the project. Additionally, make sure you can have some wins on day 1 of the project, and that progress can be communicated on the exact same day. You want to set the tone that this team will move quickly. This can be as small as setting up your weekly meeting candence, getting a supporting meeting booked, setting up your digital workspace, etc.Make time for Ways of Working. I am convinced this is the single most underrated part of managing projects. If I had a dollar for every time a PM pulled me into a project, threw tasks over the table, told us the deadlines, and then asked when they could check-in, I’d have… a lot of dollars. What’s missing from this? The human angle, which is the most important part of managing projects. If a “project manager” doesn’t know the answers to the below questions, that person’s ability to manage in a harmonious, output-enhancing way is going to be seriously diminished… Take the time to make sure every key contributor on the team has answered the below questions.How do you like to receive feedback? What are your personal boundaries between work and your personal life?What are your strengths?What are your development areas? (what are you trying to get better at) What do you do outside of work? Any hobbies? Fun facts?What are your pet peeves?How can we empower you to bring your best self to work every day?Are you a morning bird or a night owl?Do you need quiet time to process information, or do you prefer more active collaboration sessions?etc. etc. (insert your ideas here)Define and setup your place of communication immediately. Wherever the team is going to stay coordinated, make sure those properties (apps, channels, files, etc.) are setup quickly. Make sure everyone has access. Consistently link back to these places of collaboration, and try to ensure that things like file structures are easy to navigate. Clearly label files so that they’re easily discoverable later. If you spend all this time creating artifacts, but no one can discover them and no one ever goes there, then your team will suffer from inefficiencies Run a Failure Prediction exercise. After the project has kicked off and you’ve gotten going with the team, send out a survey and/or do a group exercise where every single person answers the question, “What are the two most likely reasons this project could fail to achieve what we said it would on day 1?”I use surveys when I’m in a low trust environment or in a massive project teamI ask this question in a live meeting when there is high trust and/or the team is small enough that everyone can share their opinion multiple time, with space to be a little verboseIn a 12-week long project, I’ll usually ask this around week 3 or 4. In a year-long project, around month 1 or 2 — whenever is long enough to have real performance data, but early enough that you can still get the project back on trackSetup recurring meetings with other leaders on the project and make sure you adjust your cadence to keep you tightly aligned. I’ve found that for the most important projects, we have to be meeting at least 2x per weekIn highly complex, high-stakes environments, I'm a fan of the daily stand-up / collaboration meeting. This sucks when you don’t love who you’re working with…but when you do enjoy working with your colleagues, this is one way to leverage that relationship strength into raw fucking speed. Additionally, don’t skimp on 1-1 meetings. Some things just will not be said in a group environment, and I find great joy and insight in the 1-1s with various folks on a given project. Have a list (I prefer this in slide format) of things like Key Dependencies to make sure that the team is tracking each dependency like a hawk, week over week. I recommend reviewing the dependencies you define as a team, going item by item and re-assessing if you’re doing enough to manage said dependencyHave a strategic PM (read: not the same thing as PM) to help keep you on track and focused. Ideally this person and others are actively tracking RAIDS (risks, actions, issues, and decisions) so that there’s a log of key evolutions throughout a project. I’d like to point out that PMs sometimes just do tracking of RAIDS, and that is totally fine, but your team needs for someone to be connecting RAIDS to Actions to be taken…and they need to be thinking about how to take action in a way that is harmonious.Track team morale actively. This usually takes the form of asking people in your 1-1s how you think the project is going, how it could be better, and how that person could be empowered to be even more impactful. “What is one thing that we should change to make this project more successful?” is one of my favorite go-to questions (usually people give more than one thing)Check-in regularly on both project tasks and team operations. While you’re doing your daily/weekly/bi-weekly status tracking exercise, take a step back to make sure you’re asking the entire team how things could be moving more smoothly. I love to ask this in a group setting as well as a 1-1 setting… In a 1-1 setting you get people thinking about “how could we be better?” and in a group setting, it’s their chance to share out their thinking + collaborate with others to potentially identify ways to quickly find a solution to test (…yet again helping people to see and feel momentum and improvement). Your team must become accustomed to continuously tuning how it operates, and you have to reinforce that every single person in the room plays a role, and that their voice matters. In one of the worst case scenarios, be prepared to make team member changes. Sometimes, the way a team was configured on day one just wasn’t the optimal configuration. There are many reasons why this could happen, but a quick reminder here: sometimes it just doesn’t work! I have absolutely had situations in the last few years where the person I was teaming up with was great, but we just did not mesh. Something was so fundamentally different about how we worked / communicated, that is was destined to not work. When this happens, be prepared to go into a process to either: (1) change scope of responsibilities to minimize conflict or (2) transition someone onto a different project (happened to me!). Ideally before this, you’ve attempted to do some mediation where you directly address challenges and try to work through them, but sometimes the effort to do this is both a distraction, and a potential risk to project success. There are kind, empathetic ways to make these changes. Don’t make them lightly, but don’t shy away from difficult conversations that are needed. This is the responsibility of a project leader — sometimes you have to make tough calls. It comes with the turf. (insert eloquent ending to letter that my brain can’t come up with right now).Hope you took one thing away from the letter here.

It’s my attempt to put into words this concept that has been circling around in my brain for the last year. This is definitely going to be one I come back to later and refine, so consider this a DRAFT entry. For now I’m just going to call it Balanced Management. The basic idea here is that I strongly believe there is a management middle-ground where kindness can exist at scale without creating a passive, low-performance-accepting environments. I would greatly appreciate your feedback + things you think I missed + any examples you have from either of the eight characterizations. Please leave them as a comment here on Substack or as a reply to this e-mail.Why am I thinking about this today? Two reasons. Reason one: it’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day. I grew up in a family that has extremely strong ties to the civil rights movement… Strong enough that one of my most formative experiences was sitting next to and getting advice from Coretta Scott King for over an hour when I was around 10 years old. The main takeaway from my conversation with her was that people deserve deep kindness, and that changing the world is possible with enough conviction and a bias towards action. More on this later, but one immediate thought re: kidnness is that you don’t have to be an asshole to achieve big things. Shout out to Michael Dell for writing a book largely oriented around this concept, “Play Nice But Win…”Reason two: I was just listening to the 20VC interview with Frank Slootman (CEO of Snowflake), and there was a brief part of the conversation where the host Harry and Frank talked about how about a concern they both had, and how it was potentially counter to “getting shit done.” I encourage you to listen to the interview yourself (around 17:45) to come to your own opinion, but here’s the main quote from Harry (asked in the form of a question): “…I’m worried that we’re getting into this kind of too-fluffy culture, where everything is too nice…”There is a middle-ground here. I’d like to start sharing my ideas around said middle-ground…Balanced Management is my in-development management system for running high-tempo, high-output organizations that have are laser-focused on victory both in the market and with employees. These environments are characterized by: (1) extremely high values orientation, (2) warmth, (3) trust, (4) autonomy + accountability, (5) near-radical transparency and candor. They are underpinned by: (6) true partnership with HR teams (I prefer the term “People & Culture), (7) consistent employee surveying, and (8) constant values reinforcement by leadership.Ugh, the above definition is wayyyy too dense and I’m already finding holes in it, but you know: Progress over Perfection. Here’s my rough roadmap to get to this sort of Balanced Management state: FIRST. Obsess over your company’s values. These should not be an afterthought. You should not have more than 6 values, because if your employees can’t remember your values then how the hell are they supposed to live them? With my client’s permission, I may come back and share more about a project I’ve been working on over the last month or so to redefine the values for a very high-growth business… But the main takeaway here is that your values set your cultural foundation. It’s the behavioral north star that your employees will anchor to, and if you reinforce and protect your values, you just might realize the culture you’ve asked for. One day if I decide to go start a company, the values might include things like:Competitive spirit — We are here to win. We are not here to be 2nd. This landscape we’ve entered is a competitive field, and we need to move quickly in a highly-iterative way to make sure that we outmaneuver our competition match after match, quarter after quarter, year after year, and yes: decade after decade. Treating every team member and customer with deep respect / assume positive intentBe candid. And if you can’t handle candid feedback or you aren’t willing to learn how to give it in an empathetic way, then you should not be working at the organization in question.Only hire people who you would be willing to work forWhen you’re interviewing or being interviewed, make sure critical feedback is given in both directions, and make sure you are comfortable with how the feedback was receivedInclusive environments make sure the best hearts and minds will want to be on your teamOwnership mentality. You care deeply about outcomes, and you’re willing to take ownership when things go poorly. You’re willing to share when things go poorly, because you see setbacks as an opportunity for everyone to learn. You quite literally have some sort of stake in the success of the business. Plenty of other things I’ll add on laterSECOND: Warmth. Hire people who have a bias towards kindness. Yes, these people need to be smart… ideally they have demonstrated leadership and aptitude in some way, shape, or form in their past, but they must also be kind. Do not hire assholes, because they will hire other assholes, and then you’ll have a culture full of…. buttholes.THIRD: Trust is essential to high-functioning teams. I’ll likely write an entire issue just on the topic of trust, but it is absolutely essential. You need to know that you can be super candid with your team members and that they’ll take it well (and vice versa). You need to know they have your best interest at heart, and if you do not have conviction that your own team members don’t have your best interest at heart, then good luck achieving sustainable, high performance over time. The weight of ongoing pressure to achieve will crack on a shoddy foundation of mediocre trust. What happens if you don’t have trust? I strongly recommend bringing on an outside party or coach to help your team get everything on the table and work through challenges, much like a couple might work through in couple’s counseling. Even better if you do this at the very beginning of a new team’s foundation, instead of waiting until problems arise. If you need a recommendation, I’ve worked with several and can strongly recommend one or two :-).FOUR: High autonomy + high expectation environments create leaders that will in turn grow other leaders.  There are some days when I wake up missing the big consulting firm life, but I absolutely do not miss the micro managers who needed multiple check-ins every day to see how my module/team was progressing. This is a recipe to quash creativity and to lose your highest performers. High performers crave autonomy, but they should also be held accountable. When you’re holding people accountable, focus on learning over judgement (more on this in a future issue)FIVE: Near-Radical Transparency & Candor. Ray Dalio’s hedge fund Bridewater Associates is biz-world famous for “Radical Transparency” About 4 years ago, I was interviewing there for a chief of staff-esque role, and I was struck by the utter intensity of the interview process. After every interview I was provided both affirmative and critical feedback, and was also given the opportunity to provide feedback to the interviewer. This type of culture is NOT for everyone, and I’m not going to pretend that it was easy getting such feedback as, “you showed a slight veneer of inauthenticity… I don’t know if it’s because you’re actually this really kind, energetic person or if you’re just faking something…” but it was so enlightening to get real, quality feedback like that. To have to process it… To come to terms with how you might be perceived by others —> something I find very important to supporting your ability to self love.One additional counter point here. Getting feedback can feel like shit… even for someone like me who truly does try to actively seek it out. Over time, I found out that I needed warmth and the belief that the person delivering feedback had my best interest at heart to really properly process this … velocity and intensity of feedback on a regular basis, which is why my above point about Warmth and a bias towards kindness is so important. It’s hard to really transform feedback into something healthy and empowering if it feels like an insultSIX: You have to partner with People & Culture / HR from the early days. Marc Lore (founder of Jet.com and recently Wonder) once spoke about the need to hire a People leader very early in the corporate lifecycle. I love this. I adore the idea that your “people foundation” is what enables everything else your company is trying to do. In practice this looks like true partnership with your People & Culture teams. You should have a two-way dialogue to discuss everything related to your employees’ well-being + ability to grow more “here” than “there” (another company…). They also need feedback from you too, so that their communications to the rest of your organization reflect the nuanced reality “on the ground.” SEVEN: Survey your employees regularly. It does not need to be every week, but it should be done on a consistent basis. And your employee feedback surveys should be paired up with qualitative feedback from every layer of your organization. You should also assemble groups of different people from across your organization and regularly get their thoughts (I launched a group to do this at Deloitte called the JET (Junior Executive Team). We met quarterly and gave candid feedback to Deloitte’s management team about what was going well, what wasn’t, and how to solve certain challenges. This is a specific example of how to round-out more quantitative surveying mechanisms EIGHT: Leadership must constantly reinforce values to the organization both with words and actions. One of the very very very best examples of great leadership I have seen is from our CEO, who regularly gets on a company all-hands meeting and 1000% owns up to something he didn’t accomplish, and THEN dives into exactly what he learned. He does this in front of the entire company. Think about that for a second… Look away from this screen, and think about the last time you saw a leader anywhere in your organization not only own a shortcoming, but spend time explaining what they learned about the shortcoming. This is a real example of values reinforcement. Doing this is living a value around ownership or candor or competitive spirit. It’s just like when you see an athlete in a post-game interview saying, “we just didn’t do it today… I didn’t throw the ball as well as I usually have…”Producing a culture of high-performance and kindness, and sustaining that culture over time goes far beyond bullet points on a page (like above). However, I do believe incorporating the above into your organizational management model is a really great way to at least increase the chance of success in this pursuit. I think management is one of the most noble professions, because it gives you the chance to impact the lives and livelihoods of many other people around you. We owe it to ourselves to be thinking actively about how we manage our organizations. The employee and customer experience is a human experience, and you (as a leader of anything) should be thinking about how to create the best possible human experience for those around you, working on your team, or supporting your team with their business. 1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 006 - My balanced organizational management modelCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore3Share",

I’ve been challenging myself to go beyond “thank you” and to be specific over the last few months, and it’s been super enjoyable.

This letter, sent on my final day at Deloitte to alllll of the people I worked with over the years, was one of the few times I actually managed to do it. Hope you can take one thing away from this. And WARNING: it’s a little cheesy.Note: man, I couldn’t have imagined all that would happen in a mere year after leaving Deloitte. For one, Ally.io is now a part of Microsoft (didn’t see that coming….so soon).August 2020:\"You're serious?\" That's what I said to the Deloitte recruiter who called me in Fall 2012 to let me know that I had landed one of the three full-time offers for my school. I quite literally skipped through the streets and ran home (looking real nerdy). “Pretty big moves, kid. Pretty big moves” my late brother told me one the phone about 20 minutes later.I knew that coming to this firm would seriously augment what was possible in life, and that excitement has remained constant throughout my seven-year long career here. But what 22-year old Michael did not appreciate is that Deloitte wouldn't just augment my life for the line on my resume or the project experiences (which are valuable, to be sure). Deloitte would augment my life because of the people I’d meet along the way, the beautiful moments we would have together, the personal development we would collectively experience, and the warming conviction that you I am part of a very large, green dot family.Cue the popcorn. That was super corny, but it's real. Moving on...As I depart, I thought I'd share a slightly-edited set of reminders I've written over the last seven years as I've journeyed through various groups in the firm (Technology  S&O  OCEO  Digital/S&O Doblin/Applied Design Customer Strategy). These aren't the most profound of points, but anchoring to them has proven to be valuable for me over the years. Hopefully they add at least one thing to your journey.Never underestimate the power of a smile - we work in an intense line of work, with a never-ending onslaught of deadlines and curveballs. The warmth you can bring to any situation by simply showing a smile should not be underestimatedBe bold. Take risks. Learn from failures — this is probably the single largest driving force behind my entry into Deloitte and the extremely broad experiences I’ve had during my time here. There is undoubtedly a balance to be struck between being bold and being measured (both are valuable), but this is a place of learning. That means taking projects where you actually might fail (trust me: I certainly did!). It means going out of your comfort zone in meetings. It means pushing yourself to do things you didn't think you could do. By not always taking the safe path, you might just experience the type of transformational growth that enables who-knows-what (insert your dream here).Don't forget to ask your manager / boss what dreams THEY have — Beyond getting to hear the dreams of another person (pretty cool, in my opinion), you also gain insight into how you can help them. Relationships (including between “bosses” and “direct reports”) should be two-way streetsResearch companies deeply before you start serving them — I've had a series of rituals before starting every project I've done. They've taught me so many lessons and allowed me to very quickly jump into new scenarios and be at least somewhat valuable. Here are a few:Watch videos of the CEO and or management team on YouTube. See how they speak, the words they use, the concerns they have...Remember it all when you’re meeting your clients.Read analyst reports, 10-ks, and other market reports on companies you’re serving. This is so easy to find and skimming through will give you a view into what the heck is actually happening at the companyKnow the competitive landscape of industries, and the increasingly-evident points of convergence. Regardless of how granular your project is, you should always have these macro forces in mind. How many of you have actually read our Business or Tech Trends reports cover to cover? They’re at times dense, but filled with the types of insights that can make or break your advisor relationships with clientsMake sure there is processing time on projects — Shout out to my Doblin/Market Gravity folks on this one. Working on those projects taught me the value of having days of uninterrupted time to think and generate real insights. Who knew that being strategic sometimes means actually taking time to think. My best outputs for clients came when we had some breathing room to be creative. Not building this into projects is a very quick way to jeopardize the potential Return on Effort from our projects (read: additional opportunities to partner with your clients)To the newer Deloitte folks, have a checklist of the experiences you want to have while you are here — Even if you don't know what you want to be when you grow up, there are undoubtedly some topics that you have a natural interest in. Explore the big, broad world that is Deloitte and try to get those experiences here. Let me share my list from June of 2013, right before I started. Proud to say that all of the below were accomplished!\"Work on Apple, Amgen, and Coca-Cola. Speak in front of an audience with more than 500 people. Work on technology, strategy, and human capital projects. Work in six different industries. Work internationally at least once. Write for Tech Trends. Work on at least six projects that report directly to a CxO. Make Manager.\"Last, but not least, take the time to thank those who have made a positive difference in your life and career — Gratitude goes a long way. Build in time to thank the people who have played a role in your career, and be specific about it. \"Thank you for your time\" is fine, but explaining exactly why you're thankful is better.As for what's next... (real talk: how many of you just skipped to this part? haha) If you know me well, you've probably heard of the entrepreneurial dreams I have. Working at a startup first, before striking out and potentially building something on my own, has always been one of my guiding aspirations. To help with that dream, I'll be joining the leadership team of a burgeoning little company called Ally.io in Seattle, WA. I'm really excited to apply what I've learned to a smaller, earlier-stage company before it evolves (fingers crossed) into a much larger organization. I will also be spending more time on my family's business, helping it to transform into an even more tech-driven company.In closing, Thank you for being a part of this wonderful experience. I can't wait to see what Deloitte does. I can't wait to see what you all do. Please keep in touch, and hit me up if you’re ever in Seattle! We (see below) would love to see you .With love,Michael1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 002 - The Letter I Sent When I Left Deloitte After 7 Years (and 30+ projects)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

For many years the fear of not being gloriously eloquent has kept me from publishing my perspectives and questions to the world. On top of that is the deeper fear that no one would care.But a few things have changed in the last few years.One, I’ve rediscovered the endless joy of writing. In a society where many of us are constantly plugged in, jumping from place to place, I thoroughly enjoy the refreshing focus of a full-screen Notion page upon which to write for as long as I want, on any topic I want. When I’m writing, I’m not jumping in and out of 9 meetings per day.Two, a fortuitous mixture of luck and preparation has led me to many opportunities that I relished deeply. One relished opportunity led to another interesting opportunity, which led to yet another groundbreaking project, and another hyper-complex problem to solve.... At this point in my career, I have actually spent quality time (this means no less than 4 hours of deep, dynamic collaboration) with no less than 75 organizations across virtually every major industry segment and stage of growth. Go deep with that many organizations for ~10 years straight + an annoyingly consistent audiobook/podcast/reading habit, and — in the words of my old high school football coach — “you’ve seen some things.” Things (observations, lessons, mistakes, triumphs) that might be valuable for others to learn about.Three, I strongly believe that every one you reading this has something to teach me. And by saying “fuck it” to the notion of perfection and sharing my perspectives, you might shares yours, too... And I might learn something in the process (and jesus christ, do I have a lot left to learn).This has all led to The Exonomist. The writing “platform” that I’ll use to deliver insights, ideas, and questions regarding how we might better manage ourselves, our teams, and the groups / organizations we are a part of.Here are my commitments:You can expect me to be raw (no copy editing here; expect typos..expect improper punctuation, expect me to later retract ideas because time and experience shows me shortcomings in my thinking).I’m not going to publish every day — ain’t got time for that! It’ll be around once per weekI will mostly focus on the art (and sometime science) of management, likely with about 50% focused on “self” management, 25% on team management, and 25% on organizational managementI assume that every single one of us has the potential to lead from anywhere, and therefore will always promote taking an action of some sort to pilot in your life (credit goes to Kirsi Hall for introducing me to the idea of “leadership from everywhere”)Thanks for coming along the journey with me, and sharing your ideas as well.-Michael1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 001 - Launching a Newsletter About Management (of ourselves, our teams, and our organizations)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Michael DavisDec 22, 20211Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 004 - Tactics: \"Press Pause Summit\"Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareDisclaimer: since this is only the fourth “issue”, I want to remind you of one of my principles for Exonomist — minimal-to-no copy editing. To that end, what you’re about to read was written in one go on my couch in ATL. “Strategy is about choice.” — Steve Goldbach, Chief Strategy Officer of Deloitte (and a total badass btw). When it comes to your goals, you just cannot do everything under the sun. For most of my life, I was the king of having too many damned goals. Looking at my “prioritized goals” list from 5 years ago makes me physically put both of my hands over my face (damn, smudged my glasses when I did that). If you want to actually achieve anything, you have to be deliberate about what you are not going to do, too. This takes some processing space / thinking time. Which leads me to two questions for you:Speaking of thinking time, how many hours have you spent in meetings over the last month? The last three months? The last year? OK, great. Remember that number… How many hours did you spend in a meeting that you scheduled with you and only you? I’m going to guess for most of us the answer is, “I don’t know” or “not nearly as much as I would have liked.” Just like you might attend a multi-hour meeting or all-day/multi-day conference to dive deep and learn, you should consider setting up your own “Press Pause Summit.” This is your time to reflect on what you’ve accomplished, what you’ve discovered and learned, and what you might want to achieve in the next _______(week, month, year, years). This is when I go from simply making choices about my areas of focus, to having conviction around said areas of focus.Below is a sample agenda for my latest “Press Pause” summit. If you have a different way you do this, I’d love to hear it! There are countless ways to structure this exercise.MichaelPRESS PAUSE SUMMIT - SAMPLE AGENDA:Note: my process is particularly intensive (read: probably overwhelming for many of folks), but I’ve learned that the intensity helps to keep my brain focused on this very important exercise, and not on the thousand other things going on in my life.5-10 Minutes - Expectation Setting with Others: make sure the people around you know that you’re going to be MIA for a little bit of time. Turn off your notifications. Shut off your e-mail. If you can, try to leave electronics in a place that are hard to access / check.30 minutes - Rebaseline: go on a walk, don’t listen to anything, just observe the world around you. 10 minutes — Meditation: I do ~5 minutes of deep breathing….But only after I’ve overcome being distracted by a squirrel eating a french fry, so it takes me 5 minutes to regain focus45 minutes — Writing: unstructured writing. I write about anything on my mind. Sometimes I will list out 4-5 questions (essay prompts) and write to myself. Rejoice in the joy of stream-of-conscious writing 20 minutes — Rebaseline 2: go on another mini walk. Call my partner. Do whatever I want. Probably eating some good food5 minutes — Libation 1: I get a big glass of red wine and/or a nice cup of coffee60 minutes — Structured Reflection: this is the meat of the summit. Ideally you continue writing for this one, but maybe you need a break from that… Either way, during this time I go through three questions that my OKR-loving friends will surely recognize:“What did you say you wanted to accomplish? How did it go?”“If you could start from scratch again, what would you do differently?”“Are you happy with how you spent your time?“What are you most proud of since your last Press Pause summit?”What brought you the most energy during the last (week, month, quarter, years, etc.)10 minutes — Libation 2: ohhhh this red wine is niiiiceee60-75 minutes: Go-Forward Aspirations: I usually begin here by rapidly reviewing / scanning everything I’ve written up to this point. From there I will ask myself a series of questions to get my brain moving. “What do I want to be able to say I’ve done in 12 months?”“Does what you just wrote about accomplishment overlap with what gives you energy?”If it doesn’t, consider how you could create more overlap (more to come on this topic in a future issue…)If it does, reflect on how awesome that is!“How can I spend 20-30% more time doing work / activities that will give me the most energy?”“What did I accomplish in the last 12 months, and how can I build on the momentum I gained?”“What am I absolutely NOT going to do in the next 12 months?”“Am I living my values? Why? Why not?”Alternative wording: “How do I want to grow as a person in the next 12 months”10 minutes: Taking Action: at this point, I try to summarize everything I’ve written into 5-6 bullet points. I’m inconsistent about this part. But what I am consistent about is deciding what I will do “this week and this month” to move closer to achieving my goals. The first step is the hardest step, and by committing myself to action “this week” or “today” it increases the likelihood that I’ll have some “wins” to celebrate at my next Press Pause Summit.1Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 004 - Tactics: \"Press Pause Summit\"Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Michael DavisJan 05, 20225Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis005 - Active Career Management and Being Your Own CEO (Welcome to 2022!)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareWelcome to 2022! As we begin the year (and many people start setting goals for 2022), I wanted to share my thoughts on what I call Active Career Management. This is not a comprehensive issue covering every aspect of this, it’s the starting point.Tl;dr - You are your own CEO. You are the CEO of your career, what you do within it, and how you do it. That starts with having a vision for yourself, a point of view on the bets you’ll make to achieve the vision, and a trusted group of people who can help counsel you along the way. But while you pursue this journey, be willing to adjust your goals, give yourself grace, and find ways to hold yourself accountable.Back around 2008, there was this big push for Mass Career Customization. A very senior executive at Deloitte named Cathy Benko (now a board member of Nike) penned a book that, among other points, promoted a world where employees would be able to customize their careers. I loved the idea. I wanted to take this idea further though… It felt like something was still missing. I get the notion of trying to customize your career, but the very act — no, endeavor — of customizing one’s career isn’t so simple. As I toiled on planes 2x per week, oftentimes working until 1am on projects that I liked but didn’t necessarily love, I decided to take more control of my career. “If i’m going to regularly lose sleep, be away from friends and family, and constantly feel under pressure from demanding clients and unrealistic timelines, I damned well better love who I’m working with and what I’m working on” is what I wrote to myself in my journal while my plane rocketed through a horrific winter storm from Pennsylvania to Atlanta. Here’s what I built for myself that night (leveraging concepts that I think I came up with myself, but that weren’t necessarily so novel as to be completely original…*shrugs*). Active Career Management — A Framework to Have Greater Influence Over Your Career, because life is too short and precious to be passive about what we spend so much time doing: working.Component 1: Your Personal Vision — it’s what you want to achieve in the world. When you look 3 years into the future, what does your life look like? What about six years?Example: “I want to increase the rate at which renewable energy sources are utilized in x population group.”Example: “I want to build a business unit that in ten years is the cornerstone of my company’s revenue base”Example: “I want to have curious, kind, and resilient children who demonstrate exceptional empathy in a world that is increasingly self-oriented” (wow, maybe I need to keep this one around for when we have kids??)Component 2: Your Bold & Safe Bets — what steps do you need to take now, soon, and sometime later to make this personal vision a reality? Do you need to meet certain types of people? Do you need to work to address developmental feedback you’ve received? Whatever it is, write it down, plan it out with actual milestones in your calendar over time, and review it at a regular intervalExample: “I need to work on my public speaking and sales skills, because these skills are going to be paramount to me launching my own law firm”Example: “I’m going to invest 2% of my net pay into learning how to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain”Example: “I need to leave my job in the next 16 months in order to allow myself the opportunity to explore a new sector or culture”Example: “I need to meet three senior leaders in X industry within Z geography by the end of 2022”Component 3: Your Personal Board (of directors) — the small group of people who you talk to on a regular basis, who you can be utterly transparent and vulnerable with, and who also have your best interests at heart. They will challenge you, and empower you as you achieve your goals. For me, this is a group of about 5-8 people I connect with every few months. It’s a two-way support relationship, where we feel comfortable bringing very raw ideas, challenges, and usually questions. This group should have some diversity, including: Stage of career (find people who are a bit younger than you, around the same age/level, and a couple to several steps ahead)Type of Experience (some people work in the arts, some in law, some in venture capital, some in global health, some are already retired)Tone (don’t just go to people who are going to positively reinforce everything you do and say — find people who are willing to actually challenge you)Organization (ideally you have mentors within your organization and outside of it. Do not make the mistake of only having mentors at your current job. This is NOT a good way to get a truly broad set of perspectives).Plenty of other criteria that you can tailor to your needsSo we have: (1) Personal Vision, (2) Bold & Safe Bets, and (3) Your Personal Board. Feels simple enough, right? Not necessarily. There are a whole host of things that aren’t covered in the above, but can still impact your state of mind as you pursue your career vision. I’ll call these “wraparound factors.”Some Wraparound Factors to Consider: Your goals will change. Embrace this reality and give yourself grace when your learnings about the world and yourself prompt a reconsideration of what you’re doingYour mindset is everything. Keeping it healthy requires giving yourself grace and space to celebrate your wins. Have you counted all of the things you’ve accomplished? Go ahead, do it. Count the friends you’ve helped, the skills you’ve honed, the lessons you’ve learned, the things you’ve built. Do it. Celebrate that, and give yourself some grace when you fall short of a previously-set goal.Life will hit you with the unexpected, regularly. It’s OK if you have a period of time in your life where you need to take care of other priorities! I have had sick family members, some health issues, etc. come up, and those things are foundational. Your family and your health are foundational, and your goals should ideally be compatible with these goals. Note: for some people these things are secondary. Fine for them. Just not my personal way of being, and not something that I’ve seen produce empathetic leaders (read: not managers. Leaders and Managers are absolutely not always the same thing)Your personal management system is what will keep you accountable. However you do it, find a way to track your goals. It doesn’t have to be software (e.g., Notion). It can be a white board or a notepad where you draw things out. Whatever you utilize, the most important thing is scheduling time with yourself to review your goals. No, it doesn’t need to be weekly. Reviews should happen at intervals that make sense for youIn the past, I’ve had periods of time where my goals are ultra tactical and weekly reviews are what I need to stay on track. At other times, I’ve reviewed goals once every quarter. Just depends on where you are in your life, and how focused you are on careerThe point of checking in regularly is to learn from both wins and setbacks. If you’re learning, you’re getting closer to your goals. Simply reprimanding yourself for not achieving something is the lazy path. Finding the nuggets of wisdom in what has just occurred takes more energy, but also produces more insight for you to take into the future with youWelcome to 2022, everyone. Hope you all have a wonderful year full of learning, fulfillment, and joy, and that you can take away one thing from the above to try implementing in your life.MD5Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis005 - Active Career Management and Being Your Own CEO (Welcome to 2022!)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I’ll share the story on why I shifted mostly to decaf coffee another time… But this past weekend, I YOLO’d. I had two cups of coffee over brunch with two of our friends here in ATL. It was 3pm. I thought I was safe. I wasn’t. Fast forward 12 hours, and I was still wide freaking awake.As I lay awake, I played back the last decade of my life, honing in on the key decision points. During this moonlit exercise, I remembered the first time I got a competing job offer (about 1.5 years into my career). I remembered the excitement. I remembered the conviction that it was the right thing. And then I remembered the moment when I realized that it was absolutely not the right move to make. That realization forms the basis of point 1 of this week’s letter… So what are we talkin’ about this week?Experience & Learning are a form of compensationRate of Learning (RoL) is one of the most important factors at workThere is immense value in having “multiple jobs” (note: this can be at your current company)1 | Experience & Learning are a form of compensationThe thing about work is that you are compensated in ways that go beyond near-immediate cash. I’d argue that how you feel at work (see last issue for a bit on this), and how much you’re experiencing+learning at work are also forms of compensation. About 1.5 years into my career, I almost left consulting to join a large corporation. I was fortunate enough to get the job, where I would be doing one thing, and be paid 30% more than I was making at my consulting firm. This was a super wonderful opportunity on the cash vector, but I turned it down. The reason I eventually turned down the job was because when I asked myself the below question, I couldn’t give a resounding YES.Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published“Is this new opportunity going to be a superior learning platform? Am I going to get a wider range of experiences there?”The answer was no. The job was compensating me more on the cash vector, but asking me to take a cut on the experience + learning vector. A “cut” that I knew would damage my long-term optionality. I wasn’t about to take a bet against my future like that.Over the next 5-6 years, I would get to know a bunch of different organizations who were almost always willing to pay more, but could not give me a “raise” in terms of experience + learning. I eventually did find this through joining a startup, and only then did I leave one platform to join another. 2 | Rate of Learning (RoL) is one of the most important factors at workOK, so you finally find an opportunity where the economics make sense, you enjoy the culture, and you will have access to a range of experiences and the learnings that come from them. Great! But there’s one more thing that matters here… the rate of learning. Remember that Rate = Distance / Time. Perhaps a platform can give you access to an astonishingly-wide range of opportunities, but it’s going to take you 30 years to experience said range. That would be a High Opportunity, Low Realization environment. I prefer High Opportunity, High Realization environments. Put more plainly, it is oftentimes advantageous to seek out environments that will allow you to quickly gain access to a range of experiences. This speed has a compounding effect. Just like you can achieve substantial compounding benefits from maxing out a 401(k) early, the same applies to the range of experiences you’re getting at work in a timely manner.(Note: I will write another letter in the near future on how to actually go about getting many different types of experiences without burning bridges… but one key spoiler alert note: not all bridges are meant to be maintained…sometimes the advice / energy being sent across the bridge, so to speak, are actually harmful). 3 | There is immense value in having “multiple jobs”Disclaimer before I go any further: Energy Management (yes, another future issue) is an extremely important thing. The risk of burnout is real, and I think it essential for us to consider what we can reasonably balance before committing to additional responsibilities. With that said…Having multiple jobs / roles can be incredibly valuable for making sure your Rate of Learning stays high over time. Here are some examples + anecdotes:This oftentimes takes the form of having your core responsibility at work, and then having another “extra-curricular” (so to speak) role. One of my lifelong friends (I call her JC) has her core job and then simultaneously leads a badass Women’s Network at her company, where she has played a role across every aspect of the now-annual program — I think it’s now in its 7th year! This can take the form of serving on a non-profit board. For many years, I served in leadership positions on non-profit boards, doing things like: recruiting, fundraising from people, helping to put on events, promoting these events, thinking about the branding + experience for the entire organization, thinking about pricing, thinking about stakeholder management, interfacing with the more senior board, considering how to grow in the marketttttt WAIT A MINUTE, aren’t these all things that most organizations have to do? Yes. For those aspiring to general management positions, where you hold responsibility for an entire group/organization/company, you’ll likely have to do a wide variety of things every day that have overlap with some of what I just laid out from a not-for-profit contextFor college students, this oftentimes looks like running a club, being president of an organization, etc. etc. Trying to start a new product or business line at your company. I built on confidence gained from failing + succeeding in the non-profit space to pitch more holistic, well thought-out, realistic ideas to my past company. Sure, most of the ideas were turned down, but even trying to have them get sponsored led us to meet some interesting leaders (who then became mentors).It’s no accident that many senior leaders and CxOs serve on the boards of other companies. They get to see the entire operations of another organization in real-time…learn about what is and what is not working, and then bring that elevated awareness and understanding back to their core responsibility as (insert executive title). Many of the founders and CEOs I know sit on at least one board or advisory committee of another organization, if not multipleToday, I spend many of my early mornings, late nights, and weekend mornings working closely with startup founders / people building out young companies. Beyond the fact that I find it extremely fun + fulfilling + fascinating, I oftentimes discover a new way to think about or view a problem… ways that (I’m convinced) make me substantially more effective at my core day job. I will say that you need to manage this carefully with your core organization — in my case, I am unbelievably fortunate to work for a company (Ally.io!) that is supportive of this.And again, I cannot emphasize this enough — you have to manage your energy. There are oftentimes weeks where I don’t have the bandwidth to do non-profit board work or VC stuff… And when those weeks happen, I am forthcoming about my situation. And there will again be phases of my life where I can’t sustain the pace on multiple fronts, and need to pull back. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again. I also have a pretty brutal practice of basically turning off my phone for most of every weekend, because my brain needs a break on a regular basis. I find it very challenging to basically ignore e-mails / texts / calls for that duration of time, but it is honestly one of the only ways I show up with big energy almost every Monday morningPursuing your own hobby / project. One of my wonderful coworkers has written books + launched a whole platform on salary negotiation (link here), and I know the experience of doing this had positive “spillover effects” into his day job. He demonstrated incredible consistency in these pursuits, and continues to invest time into it! I’ve framed the above conversation in the context of work, but I also want to take a step away from this thread of the convo to say that there’s a “role” or “job” that is missing from the above list, but that likely delivers some of the most badass learning + growth out there: Being a parent. A very close mentor of mine (Mom of two, global partner back at Deloitte) oftentimes would share stories about how being a parent made her a better leader, and I see examples every single day. My core manager at my core job (Ally) amazes me on a weekly basis with how she balances running an increasingly-complex organization with being a mother of three (yes, she is as badass as she sounds). Which leads me to the closing point: who you work for matters. They in many ways can enable or destroy the potential for high rates learning. If you work for great leaders, they’ll work for you, too. They’ll constantly look out for ways you can grow, they’ll coach you as you pursue growth, and they can help you keep your rate of learning high, which can even mean helping you evolve into a different team/unit/company altogether).7Share this postExonomist by Michael DavisLetter 007 - Having Multiple Jobs (no, it doesn't have to be at multiple organizations)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

So, if you’re CEO of Adam Inc., then it follows that Adam Inc. has divisions that include things like: Divisions of the Company of YouFamily (Duties — doodies if you have young kids)Wellness (of the mind and body)Time with FriendsFun & HobbiesCore Work Responsibilities (getting work done)Secondary Work Responsibilities (going above and beyond)Skills Development & MaintenanceVolunteering & Social ImpactText within this block will maintain its original spacing when publishedEmbracing a \"personal organizational structure\" like the one above can bring greater focus and harmony to a many-threaded lifeOK, I mentioned Adam above… Adam is me. This is generally how I’ve tried to bring some structure to my life, by ensuring that I’m never losing sight of the things that matter greatly to me. Each of these above Divisions have sub-divisions and sub-sub-divisions. Some quarters and years, I actually chart all of this out in Notion or a spreadsheet or in a notebook (Leuchtturn1917 is my go-to notebook). I have found this particularly helpful whenever I am stretching at work or in life in any way. If you’re waking up feeling overwhelmed more than 50% of your days, embracing a personal management structure like the above could be helpful.Having this visualized also allows you to adjust your life focus over time. Example: if within the Fun & Hobbies division, there’s a sub-division called “Reading” and a sub-sub-division called “Sci-Fi”, but I’m feeling burned out of science fiction reading (pshhh I’m never burned out of sci-fi reading…), then I would simply write, \"Revisit this division later.” Sometimes, I’ll even temporarily remove divisions or sub-divisions to enable me to hyper focus on specific areas of life.I personally find that by investing the time to chart all of this out, I have more harmony in my life, because I have less of a fear that I’m dropping the ball on something really important. Additionally, you should avoid a mistake I made early on in starting this practice: thinking you have to make progress in every category, every day. You don’t have to make progress on everything, every day, in fact that’s why I suggest adding themes to your days (see letter #9) so that you know, in advance, that you’ll invest more heavily in a specific area at a specific time.I will absolutely be returning to this topic at some point in the future, likely meshed up with the letter I’ve been meaning to write for a long time on energy management…Because I think managing your energy first means defining the categories to which your energy goes.

This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareOn the value of occasionally trashing your own plans (three tactics)“Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, yes. This… THIS is it.”Do you ever get out of a brainstorming session feeling like this? It happens to me quite frequently. I’ll feel so good about progress made, and I’ll ride a wave of optimism into the night. Feeling corporate-world heroic.This happened to me a couple of weeks ago, and then I got into my car, put on my podcast playlist, and of course I proceed to immediately hear something along the lines of “Ideas are great, but execution is everything.” You know, one of those uber popular ideas that seemingly every business guru loves to repeat at some point. Screw staying at that level. Let’s go deeper. If execution is “everything”, then how do you ensure that your execution plan is sound? I have a proposal: try to absolutely destroy your plan. I mean, absolutely trash it. Pick it apart, phase by phase, level-by-level and come up with all of the ways this thing could fail. (If you don’t know this famous scene, please watch this video. Bless you, Office Space)To spend so much time to come up with an idea, only for it to fail to live up to its potential because of poor execution sucks. Better to balance out optimism and “best case scenario” thinking with a dose of reality. Here’s my guide to trashing your own plans (and hopefully helping to fix the weaknesses in whatever it is you’re planning):Develop a project or initiative plan that lays out everything you need to do to make something happen. If doing this in a visual or gantt chart view is too difficult, just write bullet points / a numbered list Go point by point and simply ask, “What needs to be true for this to go well?”Pretend your project or initiative is a company. That company must succeed, and there’s competition. Ask yourself, “what weaknesses would a competitor exploit?”If you can’t come up with at least three points or weaknesses, you probably are not being realistic enough and/or you may need someone else to come in and help you see the weak pointsThe value in this question is that it forces you to start thinking about all the ways something could not work out. It’s basically the exact opposite frame of thinking that one of my favorite books, The Alchemist, talks about, whereby the “universe conspires in order for you to achieve it.” Sometimes, going on any journey can actually feel like the universe is conspiring for you to not achieve something, and I oftentimes have found that the most fulfilling of journeys are those where you overcome the resistanceLessons from my failed career in musicLet’s use this all in a real example: my music production business from when I was in high school —> collegeSituation: I started to produce “beats” when I was about 12, and got progressively better and better to the point where I started to sell beats for more money than I could really ever make in any normal teenage summer job. I got good enough at it that I had a not-so-small stash of cash saved up going into college. At multiple points, I considered doing it as a career path, and did seriously explore it in college. My aspiration was to produce 5 albums in 10 years, and to have the recurring revenue stream from royalties fund my startup investing goals.Outcome: I couldn’t figure out promotional and marketing channels quickly enough, and was eventually drowned out by the thousands of people who started producing EDM music in the early 2000s. I lost first-mover advantage, and I didn’t hustle enough to find people who actually knew how to do promotion, because I thought early momentum would just …magically lead to more momentum and interestWhat went well: My music production pace. I used to sit down and in the course of four hours have 3 different songs that would evolve significantly throughout each 4-5 minute song. Epic sound. I never did light listening music; it was always something that would pour through your entire body (at least that’s how I felt! ;-)). Following in the early days (had multiple songs hit 50k plus streams over the years, some of which can still be found here)Self-learning: I taught myself how to integrate softwares, write light code, and operate multiple DAWs (digital audio workstations) with very high speed and efficiencyWhat went poorly: I am not an audio engineer, and the audio quality of the music never consistently rose to the level that would’ve gotten more radio stations to play my music, and sponsors to utilize it in advertisements and films (…some got close, but most just didn’t hit the mark)I was unable to pivot traction from my metal and rock bands in high school into a new audience in EDM. I stopped serving my core segment to try and chase another segmentAfter having a record deal offered in high school, I thought that other record labels would also come to my EDM-focused offering eventually, and they just never did. I was turned down probably 20 times, and instead of pushing through, I gave up…In fairness, I was also — at that time — trying to keep my grades mega high to get into law school etc. etc. There was…limited timeMy style wasn’t consistent enough. I bounced between different music styles (hip-hop beats, ambient, club-focused EDM) and struggled to pull it through into a consistent, unique soundI didn’t invest enough in marketing, because I assumed “word-of-mouth” marketing would lead to traction which would lead to record label interest which would lead to distribution deals —> which would lead to more listeners —> etc. etc. What marketing investments I did make had really crappy ROMILack of consistency. I would put out mini albums on different platforms, rarely communicating regularly with my following at the timeDiscouragement: some people loved what I created, some people didn’t, and as a younger kid (especially) dealing with rejection was hardIf I had simply applied my “trash your own plan” way of thinking to music production, things may have turned out differently. Maybe not enough to have it be my career, but I could’ve probably gotten farther than I did (I had enough feedback from audiences live + repeat traffic from my listener segment to know that I was slowly getting onto something). If I had ran through my three tactics / questions, I likely would have landed on: You need to invest time and $$$ to find an amazing, collaborative audio engineer, and even be willing to share in royalties with themYou need to spend more time on brand marketing, and hustling to reach out to event promoters, being willing to go on earlier than other artists, and even to take lower cuts of the overall night’s take just to get more exposureYou need to have a plan to engage your audience; don’t just “do it when you feel like it” You need to do more listener tests with people who will give you tough feedback. Don’t just go to your friends who are going to say, “that’s pretty good!” …go to the friends who might say, “Dude, honestly, that last song was so bad it was an insult to the word ‘song’, and here’s why…”Your other life obligations and priorities are likely to cut into the time needed to do all of this, so either: (1) stop DJing as much, (2) find an accountabili-buddy to help make sure you spend ample time on this every week, or (3) do not pursue this at all. I can confidently tell you that I really wasn’t thinking through the above deeply enough, because I was afraid of having my baby (music) called ugly. The fear of rejection or not being positively reinforced crippled my ability to see glaring weaknesses in my plan, and my inability to get over it handicapped any chance I had (at that time) of a really successful music career. Sure, did I have fun? Hell yes I did. Did I make some money in the process? Totally. But did I achieve the plan I set out to in the beginning? No. And sometimes you just have to go through something you work really, really hard at not panning out like you hoped. There are definitely lessons in that, and I also know that the above experience has made me more effective in my professional career (…turns out the complexity of music production is not so different than the complexity of system integration, which is where my career started…). But the takeaway here is that if something is important to you — if a project, an initiative, a bold bet… If you are deeply invested in it working out, you owe it to yourself and the people around you to spend more time considering how it could not work out.  A closing line from my  journal in 2018Which leads me to the last reminder I oftentimes anchor back to these days. It’s not an original idea, but I can’t remember where I heard it from. This is a direct pull from a journal I wrote to myself a few years ago.“We wake up every day trying to achieve things. Some of these pursuits will work out, some of them won’t. These differentiated outcomes are a part of life, and failure is to be expected in the range of possibilities. But… if one must fail, it should be because you tried everything in your reasonable span of control to make it work. It should mean you thought deeply and tried deeply. Only then is failing/losing acceptable.”-My journal from Winter of 2018P.S. As I wrote this, I immediately saw images of hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of hours learning how to create art. The failure I wrote about wasn’t just some light, not-serious thing. I actually thought that it could have been my lifelong career. I visualized it. I was antisocial for a long time because of my devotion to it, and the pursuit helped me get through some pretty awful experiences in life. It was important that it would have worked out, and though I can look back on it now with acceptance, it sucked to pour thousands of hours into something, only to have it not work out. I’ve learned some great lessons from the experience, and I hope it helps you uncover even ONE thing that could tank something important to you, so that you might find a way to increase your chance of achieving whatever it is that you want to.As a reminder, I write Exonomist mostly in one pass, so you’ll probably find types, poor grammar, and otherwise sometimes-loosely written sentences with proclamations that a philosophy professor would likely find unsettling.

Jesus, was I missing the true joy and potential that comes from having the privilege to serve your employees, so that they can go do big, meaningful things. Below are some deeper musings on this topic area, as I reflect on ten years of managing teams… and still being in touch with many of the people I’ve been fortunate enough to serve over that time. (And psssst: even if you aren’t directly managing others, you can absolutely practice the below or lean into these tactics in projects that you’re participating in). Practice Servant Leadership: Managers should work on behalf of their employees; not the other way around. This mindset will keep you being people-first, and receptive to the consistent feedback you need to be an effective manager. #ServantLeadershipOrient Around Your Employees: Managers who are so preoccupied with business outcomes that they forget the career outcomes their employees have are unlikely to generate followership or  achieve outsized impactsTake Time to Develop Relationship platforms: when managers take the time to get to know their employees, levels of trust are far more likely to grow. It still shocks me how many people just rush into new relationships at work without taking time to get to know one another on a human level. You are more than yourself at work.Practice Disciplined / Sustained Mentorship > Quick Advice: My least favorite calls with people giving advice are the ones where people just talk at you for 30 minutes. It’s as if they’re trying to just pack everything they know into 30 minutes instead of discovering things about you and being intentional. I far prefer longer-term mentorship relationships, where you get to know each other, establish the trust to push back on each other, and to also help people experiment & learn over time. This is the superpower of managing teams for longer periods of time. You have the visibility and data over time to help you see what an employee may be missing (and they’ll do the same for you, if you’re open to it)Argh: I definitely broke this rule today a little bit…Need to keep working on it :)Create Space for Longer Career Check-In Conversations: My favorite conversations with my colleagues tend to be the ones where we’re taking a longer period of time (~1 hour) to dive deeper into what they’ve enjoyed doing, what they are hoping to do, and checking in on their longer-term goals… And assessing whether or not I’m helping them to achieve said longer-term goals. If the opportunities I’m giving them and/or collaborations we have are not materially enhancing their chances to hit their long-term objectives, then I’m not being a great manager. At that point, I’m just doing a job. Key thing here: don’t just make it about the current role. Engage in a more expansive dialogue that goes beyond The Now and into What Could BeAnd on that note, I’m off to pre-kend happy hour. Hope you all have an awesome rest of your weeks!Subscribe3Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#25 - Managers, Empowering the Careers of Others Is A Privilege (5 Points on How To Do It)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Simply throwing people into a team together and being optimistic is not enough.Back when Barack Obama was getting ready to start his first presidential term, there was a bunch of focus on his approach to building his cabinet, a team of rivals approach that would ensure diversity of perspectives and also personality types. Fast forward 5 years, and I’m starting the management consulting stage of my career and going through literally five straight weeks of classes and training (one taught my an ex-NASA launch engineer on how to reduce risks in complex projects, mega cool). It was in these classes that I was first introduced to a super elegant framework for understanding personality types at work: Business Chemistry. Full disclosure: this is a Deloitte IP, and it is so.good. I still have the HBR article that explains this all in great detail.The Business Chemistry (herinafter “BizChem”) FrameworkWhat you’re seeing above is basically saying…Pioneers embrace risk to create new futures. They imagine the future.Integrators connect various types of people together. They are connective tissue.Guardians create structure, embrace details, and tend to be more skeptical of change.Drivers drive work forward. They are competitive + prone to identifying roadblocks and then dismantling them.If you prefer videos for learning, go to this siteSubscribeCool, Michael, what the hell do I actually do with this framework? Four tactics for you :-)Knowledge on its own isn’t power. Knowledge applied to your actions is what creates power. And this framework can be very powerful, if you follow some of the below guides: Before you assemble a team, use this tool for each person and your own judgement) to ensure that the mix of personalities and bizchem traits are going to be in relative balance — that is, that you will have some representation of each personality typeOnce you’ve assembled the team, orient people to the framework, give them quiet time with it, and then ask them what they think they are. Have them talk about why they think they are a certain type, and to provide examples of past experiences that validate their perspectiveBe vocal about the importance of different ways of thinking / different bizchems. “Team, the only way this project is going to work as the complexity increases is if we’re all able to bring our strengths to the table. The pioneers need to be counterbalanced by the guardians. The drivers need to partner closely with the integrators, and the integrators need to help make sure our collaboration foundation is always fertile. If you aren’t explicit in showing appreciation for different types of thinking, you may find people becoming alienatedCommon example: a team of five people hasDriverDriverPioneerGuardianDriverIn the above team, how do you think the guardian is going to feel? It’s your job as a teammate or team configurator to ensure that the guardian is included, empowered, and respectedDuring 1-1s and/or retrospectives, ask people about the moments that felt empowering and energizing, and the moments that felt stifling or frustrating. It takes time to do this, yes, but you’ll both / all learn about interpersonal dynamics. Teamwork is a mindset and a muscle, and working as a team takes practice. We all need feedback and tuning to make sure we’re getting better at collaborating with others. As a personal aside, my bizchem changed pretty strongly over time, and many folks I worked with over the years also experienced fluctuations as they worked in more teams, got more feedback, learned new ways of working. I think changes in how we operate are a part of evolution… And the roles you have may demand more of one type of characteristics than others. In 2013, I had almost 0% driver in me. By the end of 2017, I was 30% driver. Today (mid-2022), I’m probably 20% driver. These fluctuations reflect evolution over time as you learn new ways of working from people who are different than you. And yes, this also means occasionally learning that a particular way of working is NOT your style and NOT compatible with how you do your best work. Which leads me to tactic #5In appreciating what you do NOT want to be like at work, you can start to hopefully reframe unpleasant/frustrating work experiences as data that can help you ensure your future teams work for you, too. For example, if you uncover that you really do not like project managers who constantly bug you for updates / micromanage, then you can come to your next opportunity and say, Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published“I’ve learned that being pinged for daily updates makes me feel constrained and unnecessarily anxious. I do my best work when we have updates a couple of times per week at set intervals, where I can actually write out my updates in quiet first. Can we construct our project management cadence in a way that takes this...regularity and predictability into account?\"And hell, no need to wait until your next project. Having a 1-1 where you ask for patience as you share your feelings with a current colleagues is a key part of high-performing teams (probably going to write a separate letter on having productive, emotionally-dicey conversations at work). You do have the power to change what’s happening Now, too.MichaelP.S. I am not compensated for any of the links to products or services I talk about in my letters.

As he waved his hands around, spilling his Guinness on my new shoes, he made a proclamation that has stuck with me to this day, not because it was wrong but because it was missing valuable elements:“Focus on getting tasks done, and you’ll get the promotions you want.”At the time, I nodded my head along, because hey: it made sense. If I just accomplish task after task, and do them well then my bosses will be happy, and I’ll get a good rating, and eventually I’ll get promoted.Nearly a decade later, I have a way of thinking about task management that helps me to almost never lose sight of the fact that tasks are just outputs, and outputs do not equal outcomes… And businesses are focused on outcomes. Task completion, then, should ideally be in support of and with appreciation for actual outcomes for the team/business.As an early-to-mid career professional, one of the single most common pieces of feedback you might get may sound like: “See the bigger picture” or “look left to right,” and it’s because executives usually are thinking at a higher level: certainly focused on execution details, but also appreciating broader business dynamics.Alright, enough preamble, here’s the meat.This is how I think about the different altitudes of project management:Level I: Task Management (getting specific, granular tasks done, what most people at a company are thinking about. Example: send X e-mail, draft Y document)Level II: Project Management (managing many tasks to complete a project, what most project managers are thinking about. Example: meet with three people responsible for a group of tasks to stay on track)Level III: Program & Product Management (managing a collection of projects to achieve some functional outcome, what mid-level managers often think about. Example: running an IT transformation program that has projects within it focused on customer data systems, finance systems, and collaboration tools for teams out in the field supporting customers). Example 2: managing a product that sits within a business’s offering portfolio (“offerings”)Level IV: Business Management (managing a business to results that have been promised to a board of directors or other principal owners, what executives are usually thinking about. Example: improving margins by 5% YoY by implementing and managing a collection of programs focused on things like an IT Transformation program (see the connection?), a Pricing program, and a Talent Effectiveness program).ShareHow this changes throughout your careerWhen you’re just starting out in your career, you’re (rightfully so) probably focused on task management, because it’s likely that your boss is also focused on task management or maybe project management. As you progress through your career and get promoted, you’ll suddenly be responsible for projects, and you’ll now have to manage others who drive tasks…But you’ll also be responsible for understanding the broader programs that the business is pursuing. And when you’re an executive, responsible for top-level business results (like revenue and cost management), you’ll have to architect strategic plans that usually have Programs, and projects within those programs. You’ll be responsible for making sure all of the pieces fit together, and you’ll be responsible for establishing a culture that can execute all of these programs.But to be next-level effective at what you do, you need to be able to jump between these different levels. And the best founders and executives I work with, are very good at changing altitudes. One way to practice doing this is to actually use the above levels as a way to communicate. For example, when you speak literally call out the level you’re thinking at, “From an overall business perspective” “From an Pricing program-level perspective…” to communicate to others where you’re sitting. It’s also helpful to do this, because it helps others around you follow your train of thought. An example from the world of commercial strategyTo wrap this up, here’s another example of how to apply this, from a Program I worked on years ago, focused on commercial operations: Commercial Strategy Example: Task (Level I): Collect data on recent purchasing behavior from top customersProject (Level II): Conduct project analyzing purchasing behavior for all customers to understand areas to improve the customer buying experienceProgram (Level III): Manage a portfolio of projects focused on growing revenue from existing customers. Projects include: (1) purchasing behavior analysis, (2) new customer experience design, (3) new customer experience implementation, (4) raw material cost streamlining project. All of these projects come together to drive results that impact the overall business in a material wayBusiness (Level IV): Managing a collection of programs that drive business results. This could mean driving several programs like the one I outlined in Level III, and also being accountable for their efficacy to, for example, a board of directors that is expecting certain company-level results from a management team. Management teams typically are focused on Levels 4 (primarily) and 3 (secondarily)To close, as you think about your career, and especially as you want to take on more responsibility, you must understand the differences in altitude here. The skillset required at each level is a bit different than the others, and a “rookie mistake” of new managers of programs is that they get too mired in the details of tasks (details matter; you should care about them, but you have to create space for the bigger picture thinking too…more level IV thinking, where you appreciate how many different teams and programs can and maybe should fit together). 4Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#27 - Altitudes of Project Management (Spoiler alert: it's not the same as business management)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

As a reminder, Exonomist is intended to be written in raw form — expect typos, imperfect ideas, and for me to come back later and disagree with myself :). I’ve had many bosses in my life, more than most due to 8 years of management consulting where I frequently jumped between projects. I’m still close with many of them (I write this from Brooklyn, where we are spending the weekend with…one of my old bosses!). I’ve taken away lessons from every one of them, but there’s one lesson from a recent boss that I’ve taken very deeply to heart, and it is this: Seeing what’s possible is a mindset choice. I remind myself of this almost every day now, because the fact is that there is opportunity in front of us at all times. Opportunities to learn, to laugh, to achieve, to help, etc. And when faced with a new scenarios at work, it’s easy to start counting the things that are unfortunate, frustrating, or morale-killing about a situation. I view my role with everyone I work with to help people see what’s possible, and I think the world could be a little better if we all spent more time doing this for the people around us. Here are some examples: When you have a new boss, embrace the fear, but also the excitement that comes from a new relationship When you start a new project, instead of just counting the things that are wrong / disadvantageous, start framing these things as learning opportunities or chances to help improve how you and others approach work / getting shit done When your favorite shirt is in the laundry and you’re like, “damn…I really wanted to wear that shirt”, embrace the other options you have in your closet, maybe something has been overlooked (this is definitely the first time I’m talking about clothes in this blog)Overall, embrace a healthy dose of optimism, and share it genuinely with people around you (genuine is the key word, because it’s super annoying when someone is way too excited and way too positive about everything — I believe the more elegant word here would be “insufferable”)When you share your optimistic lens with those around you, you will allow them to see what’s possible, and it’s only when we see what’s possible that we make progressAnd that’s all most of us are really trying to do every day: make progress. Your mindset towards what’s in front of you will determine your degree of progression. Don’t take your mindset for granted. On that note, we’re off to go take a long walk, get some coffee (no decaf today — we’re embracing full caffeine… the devil’s elixir as I like to call it), and embrace what’s possible in today.Subscribe2Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#28 - Seeing What's Possible is a Mindset Choice Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore1Share",

As a reminder, Exonomist is intended to be written in raw form — expect typos, imperfect ideas, and for me to come back later and disagree with myself :).Section 1: Of Funnels, Ice Cream Shops, Dating, and GardeningIf you work in any business where you are held accountable to targets, there’s a good chance you’ve heard the word “funnel” many times. I first came across it in the context of marketing. Here is what it is (credit to Desi Velikova for the graphic). (TOFU = Top of Funnel, MOFU = Middle of Funnel, BOFU = Bottom of Funnel. And if you aren’t taking advantage of the opportunity to say “Tofu!” at work, then what are you doing with your life?).As time has gone on, I am seeing this god damned graphic everywhere in my life. Here are some examples of funnels: People standing outside an ice cream shop —> deciding to go into the ice cream shop —> deciding to buy ice cream —> deciding to come back three days late because, damn, that cinnamon toast crunch vanilla mix was life-enhancingDating in the modern era: think about going on app —> sign up for app —> use app —> (hopefully) get some matches —> (maybe) go on dates —> some of them don’t work out, but some of them do. For those that do —> go on more dates (retention) —> decide to commit (loyalty) Gardening: deciding to garden —> buying seeds —> planting seeds —> some of the seeds do not sprout healthy plants. Some of them do. — For those that do, a subset of them will sprout yields like tomatoes and peppers. In each of the above three examples, there’s one thing in common: You start with a lotOver time/space, that “a lot” gets dwindled downAfter the dwindling, you’re left with somethingShare Exonomist by Michael DavisThis is reality in business. Almost everything follows this pattern. You try to generate interest in your product (TOFU) —> you try to nurture intent to actually buy that product (MOFU) —> you try to keep people buying said product over and over again (BOFU). And if you’re not providing enough value to your customers, they do this really painful thing called churn.Now that we’ve cleared up what a funnel means, let’s move into the main reason I opened up this writing zone today…Section 2 : Funnels Can Apply to Your Every Day (including outside of work)I was talking with one of my colleagues earlier this week about the “sheer number of opportunities we can go after, and how we have to be careful to not go after every single thing in front of us.” …And that conversation stuck with me after it ended. Enough that I wanted to share the key points from it. Here are some bullets: Just like a company has a TOFU area where many potential customers are coming into contact, you have a TOFU that is comprised of all the things battling for your attentionYou have a choice in what you provide your attention to. Are you going to go after every single opportunity that comes? Sure, you could… but you’ll probably spread yourself thinner than a barely-visible layer of peanut butter on a piece of breadYes, there are times when you need to pursue a large number of things (like when you’re starting a new business), but my point is that it shouldn’t be your long-term steady state to do thatUber point: when you work at a place where you have some degree of freedom over what you work on / pursue… Some…say in the matter, you shouldn’t just jump after each thing that comes before you. You should consider them, put them aside for a bit, and then come back and commit once, and only once, you are sure it’s worthy of being a priority for youReal-world example from my past life in consulting 1. You get e-mails asking you to volunteer for proposals (helping to sell  work to clients)2. You get e-mails asking you to volunteer for research initiatives 3. You get e-mails asking you to mentor high-school students4. You get e-mails asking you to attend an optional training5. You get more e-mails asking you to volunteer on more proposalsAnd if you say yes to everything, you are fucked. You will not sleep, you might realize the thing you pursued was a near-total waste of your time, etc. EVEN BETTER IF, you don’t just automatically say “YES!”, but you wait … You wait until you know the thing before you is something that is going to be a priority for you, either because you’re going to learn something, enjoy the process, advance your career, or ______(insert point about the investment of your time driving value)You know what’s fun? this letter is somewhat of a counterargument to my last one around how #28 Seeing What’s Possible is a Mindset Choice. But I’d argue that there is nothing wrong with clearly seeing all of the opportunity around you… But just because you see opportunity does not mean you should pursue every one. This whole notion of being selective / choiceful in what you work on just gets more important the higher you go. As a CEO or departmental leader, you are given extremely wide latitude to focus your teams on all sorts of things. If you just have them attacking every single potential opportunity, they will burn out or not do the work well. Sun Tzu said it best: If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.And, as this letter closes, I want for you to think about how important it is for you, and your career, to benefit from saying No to some opportunities at your job…To be choiceful about what you work on, to not attack everywhere. Enjoy the weekend! And if you want to read another letter somewhat connected to this one, see #17 Not Going To Do ListMDShare Exonomist by Michael DavisP.S. I want to point out that this advice applies to jobs that are currently running and where you have a degree of freedom in choosing / influencing what work you do. There is absolutely a hierarchy of needs in the world, and sometimes you just don’t have the privilege of being selective. Sometimes you have to take whatever comes your way. This letter, then, is focused a bit more on when someone has achieved a higher degree of freedom at work.1Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#29 - Funnel Like It's Hot & Why Saying \"No\" Enables High-Quality WorkCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

During this time, you don’t just read: you write, you draw, you teach others, and you do it all after having consumed many different forms of media on a topic. If you want an example output, skip to section 5 for notes on my latest Immersion Marathon on Climate Tech0 | Why Immersion Marathons Are On My MindI don’t know nearly enough about climate technology, and that’s…pretty awful considering how important it will be to the future of our species. This became immediately clear to me while diving back into Speed & Scale, John Doerr’s new book that is all about how the climate crisis can only be delayed (read: reversing is currently impossible) if we move with immense speed and at a broader scale than we ever have before. In the book, John delivers a plan to help save the planet, and gets specific about different technologies and policy goals we need to pursue. And as I was reading more of the book, I at one point just dropped it on the couch and thought, “You really, really need to learn more about climate technology.” Great goal… Now, where the hell to begin?1| First, A Definitionan Immersion Marathon (IM) is a period of time where you almost-obsessively consume and create content oriented around a given topic. On the consumption side of the equation are the different forms of information you can consume — books, articles, videos, podcasts, graphics, etc.On the creation side of the equation are the different ways you can demonstrate/practice what you’ve learned. This usually looks like: process flows, written notes, graphics you’ve drawn, telling someone else about what you’ve learned, writing your thoughts in the form of a short memo2 | Where the Hell Do You Start? My preferred way to start an IM is to consume a form of media that has been highly recommended by at least two people I personally know. From there, i’ll then brand out into all of the forms of information I listed above. In summary, my typical flow is: Read a book on a topic (or read a summary if you don’t have time)Watch a YouTube video on the topic (ideally it has a decent # of positive reviews — and if it isn’t interesting, then move onto another one)Read 2-3 articles on a topic (I try to stay towards mainstream publications that tend to ground in academic research — sorry CNN/Fox/MSNBC, probably not going to include you here…)Read the Abstracts of 2-4 academic papers on a topicListen to a podcast on the topic, at 2x speed until you find something you really like and then slow it down to let the insight data/perspectives a bit more :)Ideally talk to someone who is deep in the topic. Tell them what you’ve been reading/consuming, ask open-ended questions (“What is the most exciting development in X sector that you’ve come across in the last three years?”)3 | It’s Critical to Create from the Moment You Start (#BuildMomentumNOW)I learned this in strategy consulting. In that world, if you started building the deck for your final readout (8-10 weeks from start of project) in week 4, you’ve lost (or you’ve set yourself up for pain). We started building the final readout literally on day 1. Here’s how this applies to an IM: Before you even open a book / listen to a podcast, identify where you will take notesAs you consume content, write down what you’re hearing, what you’re wondering. It’s similar to being in a lecture at schoolThe system I used throughout school and consulting was my own not-easy-to-remember mechanism called PQCIPoints (to remember)Questions (to get answers to)Challenges (to the thing I’m hearing)Ideas (for how this could be better)Ideally, you keep your notepad or note page open the whole time you’re going through this learning exercise. I recognize it can be a bit difficult to jump back and forth, but I find that it keeps my mind from lulling itself into just flipping pages. The back-and-forth can help keep you focused and engaged4 | Share Your Thinking with Someone Who CaresYou know you’ve learned something when you can teach others. I try to make it a point to always share what I’ve learned — even if it’s a 30-second summary — with friends and colleagues. A really powerful way to do this is to re-read all of your notes, and then create a short summary. I use bullet points (shocking!!) to call out the key points.5 | Here’s the summary I wrote (for myself) for climate technology (my other notes are wayyyyyyyyyy more dense, but the point of summaries is that it is kept at a high-level)The planet is warming at an alarming rate, and the underlying drivers of climate change are not being mitigated quickly enough.The shift to EVs (electric vehicles) will help, but it will not solve the climate challenges we face. It will take action acrossGrid decarbonization Food sustainability Rapid-response climate effect mitigation (putting out fires, redirecting water that could cause floods, etc.)Carbon capture (a bit of a hail mary but still something we must pursue)Policy frameworks — not just ensuring that climate stays a top, priority issue for voters, but also that politicians and the broader political ecosystem continues to push action that helps us achieve our goal of limited greenhouse gas emissionsWe must continue to support climate-oriented innovation, both from a technology perspective and also a policy perspective. Companies like Helion Energy who are focusing on advancing fusion technology Companies like Wattch who are providing data and control infrastructure for solar energy Companies like ZeroAvia that are building hydrogen powertrains for planesCompanies like AMP Robotics who are building AI-powered robotic systems that can more effectively sort for recyclable materials Companies like Rivian who are helping bring an EV-driven future (hey, it can’t just be tesla. There’s a reason why Tesla made much of their IP available to other automakers)(btw, if you know any climate tech founders, please send them my way!! Actively trying to make at least two angel investments into earlier-stage climate tech before the end of the year).To close, I recommend visiting SpeedandScale.com.

I really try to sit down, write out my thoughts, and press send. This means you’ll find typos, and occasionally undeveloped ideas that I do have a habit of later refining.Tl;dr — when taking on a new project/program or recruiting others to your effort, make sure to communicate / ask about the scope, complexity, time, and resourcing dynamics for the project. If you want to read more about what to do once the project has started, I recommend reading Letter #8: Tactics for Running Kick-Ass Projects.I was having a conversation with one of my colleagues this week about project selection. We were talking a bit about how one goes about taking on projects that have increasingly broad impact potential. Said more plainly, the process of going from managing smaller projects to larger and larger programs. Letter #29 I wrote (“Funnel Like It’s Hot) (god damnit I am corny) was all about funnels, and how you should see incoming opportunities for things to work on as a funnel — not automatically saying “yes” to doing something, but thinking carefully about the effort before you commit. But how should one go about…scoring a potential project? That’s the focus for today’s thoughts. Before you take on a new effort, you should think about the Scope, Complexity, Time, and Resourcing of the effortWhenever approaching a new project, I always think through these factors. The value of doing this is that it requires you to consider, in advance, why the project might fail. I wrote a bit about this in Letter 8 (Tactics for Running Kick-Ass Projects) if you want to dive into that for details of what to do once you’ve already decided to pursue an effort. Allllllright, so what are these factors and why do they matter? Scope: the span of impact for a project.Narrow scope = designing the lid on a to-go coffee cupBroad scope = transforming the entire supply chain for a coffee companyComplexity: the number of factors that must be simultaneously understood and managedLow complexity = having a 1-1 conversation about a rough idea you have with a colleague you know wellHigh complexity = facilitating a 200-person workshop, where the workshop has 10 different sub-areas of focus, and oh by the way the attendees are spread out across 10 time zonesTime: the target duration of an effortLow time = sending a text message to my wife to say, “Hey! Love you!”High time = embarking on a multi-year turnaround of a business unit that is going to involve changing the entire product offering, shifting the supply chain, and re-tooling the entire go-to-market capability stackResourcing: the people and technology powers you have at your disposal to accomplish the projectTight resourcing = “You’re not getting any FTE support on this. You can take one hour per week from these two people who might have some spare time, but no promises. Might end up just being all you on this one”Drowning in $$$ resources = “I don’t care what it costs. Get it done. Move however many people to this project that you need. Oh, you want to hire BCG to help you with strategy & transformation? Go for it — here’s five million dollars. Totally OK if you go over budget, just get it done.”Before you take on a new project/program (or even pitch it to your colleagues), you should make sure to have an understanding of these four dimensions first. It will help you: A. Give better guidance to your employees about what is going to be required to achieve project success, or B. Give you, as the potential project member, a framework to ask clarifying questions…to help you understand if you want to do the project or, even better, the blind spots that the person trying to recruit you might haveI WISH I had been better about asking these questions before taking on new projects years ago… There were definitely times where I signed up for something, not fully appreciating the scope or resourcing, only to be miserably researching and building content at 10pm on a Friday night because I didn’t say, “Hey, this feels really broad. Can we bring in one or two more people to help tackle various aspects of this?”Your time is too important to take on new efforts without understanding the fundamentals of the effort. If you take the little bit of extra time to make sure you understand these four dimensions, I promise that your project is far likely to be a successful and enjoyable experience.

The word was: Care. My immediate response was, “Ugh, why couldn’t you have just said that in the subject line?” But my follow-up thought was, maybe there’s something more here. Immediately my brain shifted to thinking about all of the people I’ve worked with who are just…next level. They’re the ones who command respect, who drive results, who lift others up and drive inclusive environments. And the one thing they all have in common is deep respect for others — their opinions, their needs, their strengths, their development areas, their agency + sense of belonging.Before I get into my bullet-point list for today, here’s a picture of the team that taught me that respect and care for others should apply even and especially when you’re working 80-100 hours every week, under immense stress, sacrificing precious time you could be spending with your family to do something in the world. (I put my shades on right before this picture for some reason. Sometimes, I’m a little too much. The guy at the front is now also at Microsoft with me, and I’ll never forget him spending hours with me teaching me about technology architecture, showing respect for where I was in my journey. Every person on this team helped each other, created an inclusive environment, and ultimately we launched a really awesome platform to help curb child abuse).Respect looks like: Ensuring everyone’s voice at a meeting is heard Not interrupting when people are speaking Being cognizant of why you’re meeting in the first place, and not derailing with your own side-thoughtsListening, and not just waiting to respond with the point in your brainAnticipating what different people may want out of a meetingIf you’re an intern, this means anticipating the questions or needs of your bossIf you’re a junior employee, it means carefully noting what your manager is saying whenever they speak, and making sure to incorporate it into your communications + workIf you’re a senior executive, it means anticipating that others might be intimidated by you, and going out of your way to make sure they feel included enough to speak up (and if you aren’t doing this, then why the shit are you paying for them to work at your company?)Actively thinking about the emotional states of others while driving towards business resultsNoting how you and others can improve. As I probably say too much, even LeBron James has a coach — and then actually thoughtfully telling themThis can be everything from, “I really loved how you did X, and I’d love to see you do it even more!”This can also be, “Candidly, x comment you made came across as a bit harsh. I know you didn’t mean it, but here’s why it came across that way. You might want to reach out to person A to just check in on how it landed + how the message could have been communicated differently”Following up after a meeting with additional questionsMessaging someone before a meeting to see if there’s anything you can do to help them run a successful process Thinking through every stakeholder in a project or meeting and making sure you understand how to both engage and support themShareThat’s it, really. I really don’t need to write anything else as of now, because if you just do these things above, everything else you do at work will go more smoothly. You’ll have a higher-performing team. You’ll feel good for empowering others. You’ll actually be more engaged at work.Jk, there’s one more thing (ehhh, Steve Jobs tactic strikes again!): applying these tactics above is good, but living from the first principle of Respect and Care for others is how you’ll apply them well and lead change in your own environments. MD(P.S. we aren’t perfect. Sometimes we break our own principles. This will happen, and when it does you need to accept that you fucked up and learn from it. Don’t blame others; accept responsibility ==> grow ==> thrive).Subscribe2Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#32 - Deep Respect / Care is a Shortcut to Being a Badass at Work Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Didn’t matter if it was economic development, consulting, investment banking, advertising, or robotics (all industries I targeted out of undergrad), Classics was always the thing that got people curious. My own curiosity for Classics goes back to early high school.The Path to Classics:So how did I get to Classics? It started off In my mid-teenage years, when I was an absolutely awful student, if you judged by my grade reports. The exact numbers evade me all these years later, but my GPA was something like a 2.3 or 2.4 going into my Sophomore year of high school. Not great. I was always interested in what I was learning, but just not interested enough. A series of things happened in my sophomore year that pushed me to turn my academic life around, but studying Classics was really the major turning point for me intellectually.I was fortunate enough to move to a school that actually offered Greek and Latin classes when I was a Sophomore. It was a massive culture shock for me, but my Classics courses were one of the first (read: only) places where I felt like I was on equal footing with my classmates. My math skills were fine, but not great at the time; my history knowledge was meh; my grammar was fine (don’t criticize my use of semi-colons, dude — I’m free writing right now). Everyone around me seemed to have been taking advanced/honors courses since they were in the womb. In every class, I felt completely, utterly outgunned, but in Classics, there was no structural advantage: it was brand new to all of us, and therefore I could use it as a “test” to see what I was capable of.I think it was the mix of history and learning an entirely new system of thought that enthralled me. You see, to be able to write in Koine (ancient) greek (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek) or Latin, you have to understand context…nuance. You need to appreciate the time in which something was written…The history of how grammatical structures evolved over the ages. It wasn’t just rote memorization that would get you the A+… You had to understand the ecosystem…the “matrix” that surrounded a single.word. It was utterly ridiculous to have to think at this level to understand that the word “aletheia” (it means Truth) could mean many different things depending on the words around it, and the era in which the words were written. Holy shit that’s cool! (can you see why I chose to major in Classics?).Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareDialing up my Focus on Classics (with a heavy side of Economics)Fast forward to my senior year and I’ve had two years of Greek and Latin under my belt. It’s 2008 and the economy is falling apart; our burgeoning family business is going through its second existential crisis/threat, and I’m trying to make sense of the fact that now all of a sudden we’re once again hyper concerned about our economic wellbeing (the prior year was one of the first times likely in our multi-century family history that we felt economic comfort). Probably out of a sense of desperation I tried to understand why our economic wellbeing was being so threatened. Interest rates, what? Money supply? Consumer sentiment? Stress tests for banks? Supply and demand? I wanted to understand why — out of nowhere — my family was hyper concerned about our ability to pay our bills or avoid diving into a credit card interest spiral. Why?During that time, many pundits on the hyper-balanced news networks (….) would talk about crisis, and how so many things signaled the “beginning of the end” and I started reading up on why Rome fell, only to discover that economics played a large role in determining the outcomes of a civilization — a collection of city-states. So, while I am studying ancient Greek and Latin, I’m also studying modern and historical Economics, and the world suddenly started to make more sense. It was the first time I felt a sense of enlightenment / illumination about how the world’s civilizations interacted, and I was addicted to the intellectual jazz of these two topics. If I could understand how ancient civilizations rose and fell, and also understand how ****money — an underlying aspect of all modern society — played a role in our daily lives, well then maybe I could make a positive difference in the world and/or help modern organizations move in a way that overcame so many of the mistakes that one can discern and avoid from studying history and appreciating CONTEXT and NUANCE.Shift forward to 2009 and I’m entering my Freshman year of college. My stated (deliberate) mission at Bucknell was to, “understand how civilizations rise and fall, and ideally uncover ways that we can delay or altogether avoid our own fall as an American civilization.” I continued taking a super wild mix of courses — Roman Civilization, Macro and Microeconomics, American Poetry, Computing Systems & Architecture. At this point, I’m starting to learn about how ancient people lived their lives, how our economy works, how words can be so powerful, and how technology can propel humanity forward (or endanger it). So, imagine doing this for four years, and all of a sudden you have a really odd/special/awesome mix of things.Six Ways Classics (and Economics) Impact my Career Today:So let’s fast forward to today, 2022. This foundation of Classics and Economics (and other topics) influences how I show up every day to work. And I believe the combination has played a really key role in the relatively fast career progression I’ve had. At this point, I’m going to switch back to more typical Exonomist-style writing and drop some bullet points.Context & Nuance: Classics, as I’ve alluded to above, is all about Context and Nuance. Imagine, for a moment, obsessing over the context around a situation you have at work, and the details that influence what you’re currently experiencing?Think about the last time you disagreed with someone on an approach to take. Did you deeply listen to the words a person chose to use? To the cadence of their voice? To the time of day/year it was said? To the tone? To the hesitation? To the duration of their words? All of these dimensions come together to signal Something about the person and what they care about and how they feel. If you can appreciate this, you will be able to navigate work / collaboration more effectivelyDeep Study of a Topic (and the many interpretations / opinions around a topic) will help you better understand what is optimal or correctIn Classics, you’re exposed to many different “translations” of the very same text. And mind you: these translations are into many different languages. You ask one scholar what the opening line of the Aeneid ****or the Iliad means, and their opinion is likely to differ from others, even if only slightly.In the business world, **this has helped me to never over-index on one point of view…**To remember that there is usually no “right” answer, and instead many different approaches to take… and by asking questions, listening, and having healthy debate you and those around you might find some new path forward togetherLanguage Choices: In the Classics, the very same word can mean different things in different contexts. It teaches you to not assume that you understand something at face value, but that there might be a deeper story — a deeper Why — to a word or to an action.If you view the world this way, you start to track cause + effect relationships more, and to embrace the curiosity of how the “same” cause can have very different effects / outcomesExample: “I want to leverage your skillset” vs. “I want to leverage you” vs. “Can we find a way to partner together?”Meditate on these three phrases. They can very easily mean different things depending on context, tone, and existing relationship dynamics, but even without all of that the word choices communicate different mindsets. “Leveraging” someone can be super transactional and impersonal, not to mention dehumanizing; “partnering” with someone has a far more egalitarian, collaborative tone.Think I’m overthinking this? Wait until you have and/or reflect on a time when you presented to or wrote a communication for thousands of people…All of sudden you’ll appreciate how a single word can be interpreted a thousand different waysThe best communicators appreciate how choiceful you need to be with words, especially when communicating something complex or emotionally charged — this applies both to work in a for-profit company and especially in a public service contextThe Era Within Which You Live and Work Matters, and this isn’t just the temporal era — the 90s the 2010s, etc. — it’s also the era of leadership and the associated culture you experience. At work this can mean the leader you work for, or the industry dynamics that impact how your organization achieves or fails to achieve your target outcomesWhen I was working for Deloitte’s CEO, she ushered in an era defined by the power of vulnerability, career intentionality, diverse experiences, and intellectual safety. This context allowed people to speak more candidly, to pursue career opportunities with a decreased fear of retribution from managers who didn’t want to let “resources” go, etc. (not saying these things disappeared…)If you pay attention closely to how your leadership communicates — the words they utilize, the tone of communication — you can learn much about how to make an impactI once had a client who’s motto was, “Always be on Offense”This communicated a form of aggression, or high-tempo behavior… of prioritizing winningI had another client who’s ethos was all about “Purpose and joy at work” — sure, they were still focus on winning economically, but their first priority was the culture of the organizationHow you would communicate to these two leaders would be different. I probably wouldn’t have made an impassioned speech about purpose, culture, belonging, etc. to the CXO who was hyper concerned with “being on offense” “taking marketshare from competitors” and “being brutally efficient”…But nuance tells you that these two leaders could have some degree of overlap, adn the “Purpose and Joy” and “Being on Offense” can potentially co-exist, but you need to consider the timing of your message, and the tone of it as wellGenuine curiosity and almost “unreasonably deep” study of a topic can reveal neat aspects of the world around youExample: I was recently catching up with a founder who I angel invested into about a year ago and we were talking about what would compel someone to switch from a product they’ve been using for years to a new one (the founder’s). We talked about having a strong value proposition, and pricing the product appropriately, and making sure that “the core market for the product knew that we existed” …but then there’s also the exact words, and the order of the words, and the tone, and the colors, and the placement of the words that matter. We literally spent 30 minutes diving deep into this single topic, evaluating all of the different ways a single word or term could come across to different buyers, which ultimately led the founder to invest some more time researching a slightly new segment of the market (..and I tell this story because that new market we talked about has been a key to a new phase of growth! They’ve honed their messaging and the channels that they put marketing investment into, and they’ve gotten a higher ROMI (return on marketing investment) from this new segmentEconomics is largely about incentives, decisions, scarcity dynamics, demand, and size and vitality (speed?) of markets for goods and services. There’s much more to it, but these are some pretty foundational aspects of the field. In the business world, economics underpins everything…. And it’s not whether or not you have a good product that matters, it’s whether enough people care about it enough to pay for it, ideally over and over again, despite decreasing scarcity to whatever you’re offering (read: competition).Most ancient civilizations grew into positions of dominance because they had some product or set of products (precious metals, diamonds, foods, technologies) that other civilizations (read: organizations) were willing to pay for, over and over again. This is how we these civilizations funded the projects and expeditions that would shape their world and the world they traded withThis even shows up today in modern markets. Co-opetition is an example — a case where one company both competes and transacts with another company.Example: Microsoft has Teams, Facebook has Facebook At Work, but they also have an exclusive partnership around virtual realityIt also shows up in global politics — China buys many products from the US, the US buys many products from China, people travel back and forth between these two countries, and yet they’re currently competing for power on the global stage. Their economic positioning influences the values their respective cultures elevate and de-emphasize, and this extends to the day-to-day interactions citizens from these two worlds have with each other… And you have to appreciate this context when doing business, or — more specifically — making business decisions.Closing ThoughtsI graduated from Bucknell nearly ten years ago, and yet I still think about many of the above topics every day. They make life more rich, more interesting, and an appreciation for all that I learned through studies both before, during, and after college + what I have learned by just living life in the post-college world actively improves my ability to show up and make an impact in life…Whether it’s noticing that someone is having a shitty day and needs some grace, or appreciating that the competitive dynamics in B2B SaaS are shifting ever-so-slightly, and small shifts open up opportunities (that companies like my old startup could take advantage of!).Have an awesome weekend everyone. If you made it to this sentence, I am shocked.MichaelThanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

It is enormously difficult and unlikely to actually scale a revenue base like this, and yet it happens. How do companies do this? This letter will start answering how it happens. I’ll plan to write Part 2 at some point in the next few months, but for now…Section 1: Two pathways to growth (customer-solution fit; JVs & partnerships)Section 2: Definitions of Joint Ventures and Channel PartnershipsSection 3: How to Drive Success in JVs and PartnershipsSection 4: Bottom-Line Takeaways + Partnerships Aren’t A Magical Cure for Fundamental Product Problems**Section 1:**There are so many pathways to this kind of growth, but I want to highlight two in particular.1. At the customer problem level, this can happen when a team gains a crystal clear view of an as-yet-unsolved issue for a potential customers, and then delivers a solution that delivers such quick and repeatable benefit (value) that they are willing to pay for it over and over again. **Customer and solution fit**2. At the go-to-market level, this can happen when you uncover another company that somehow enhances either your product’s value, your ability to gain customer attention + access, usage or (ideally) both. **The Partnerships function** is a powerful way to leverage an ecosystem around your company to drive growthBut critically, a Partnerships function without a compelling underlying product isn’t going to drive growth. The two must exist simultaneously and inextricably (weird grammar here, but go with it)**Section 2:**Over the years, I have definitely conflated “joint ventures” with “channel partnerships.” Frankly, the two terms are interchangeable to many people, but I do not view them as the same thing. Note: If you’re newer to these disciplines, read this section. If you already know it, skip to the next section.Joint Ventures are the most intense form of partnership. In a joint venture, a company might have resources from every major corporate function (product, engineering, sales, marketing, legal, finance, IT, people, etc.) engaged tightly together. Many Joint Ventures feature two distinct companies allocating large sets of people to work on a new endeavor full-time. Example: two cell phone carriers establishing an independent corporate entity to provide a targeted cell phone service to a specific market. Maybe they don’t want to take on all the risk themselves, so they spread the risk (AND gain expertise) by partnering with another company that is also interested in capturing a part of a market.Channel Partnerships are a actively managed collaborations between two (or more!) organizations. A company can have many channel partnerships, and doesn’t *necessarily* dedicate meaningful FTE (full time employee) time to each partnership.An example of a channel partnership is when one company, let’s call them Spiller & Co., produces a coffee management software platform. The coffee platform they’ve produced is loved by the customers they have, but they don’t have the funds or expertise on staff to effectively market and service their platform over time. What do they do to grow?They “partner” with a software reseller, Maven Inc., that has relationships with many coffee and tea companies around the world. Spiller & Co. provide the software at a discount to the public price of their software ($10 per user per month for Maven instead of the typical $20 per user per month, pupm). So, for every license that Maven sells to their wide network of customers, they will keep the difference. To drive sales volume, Maven offers the software at $18 pupm to their top customers, and therefore keep $8 pupm. Which means if they successful can sell Spiller’s software to, say, 20 companies who collectively have 50,000 users, that’s:500k per month in revenue for Spiller & Co., and400k per month in revenue for Maven & Co.Together, these two companies collectively generate $900k in revenue every month, or ~$11m per year…and software tends to have very high margins (the money you sell the product for minus the money it took to develop the product and get it to market), which translates into higher net income (in accounting parlance it “flows to the bottom (line)”)In some cases, Spiller & Co. might pursue partnerships that are more about Servicing customers versus selling software, because maybe S&C only has money to hire one sales person and one customer service person per year, but they ***want*** the power of an entire field force of sales and service people… **Instead of taking all that risk of hiring your own people,** companies oftentimes choose to setup a partnership with another service provider to supplement their own on-staff capabilitiesExample: Spiller & Co. sells software to customers, **but** the customer wants to have more intensive technical support for all of their employees who will use the product. Said customer is willing to pay $200k to have on-demand technical support from a dedicated team. But Spiller doesn’t have this team on staff… so they sell to the customer alongside an IT support consulting firm. **Spiller sells software, but they provide a business opportunity for a consulting firm to make some $$, and the customer gets what they want**(If you think I got any of this wrong, please leave a comment letting me know! I’ve worked in the space for a while, both in a manufacturing products and software product context, but continue to sharpen my understanding every day)**Section 3:**What Drives Successful JVs and Channel Partnerships?So, you get the fundamentals of JVs and Channel Partnerships, but what do you do to make it a winning part of your business strategy? I’m going to share a first draft of some takeaways I’ve gleaned from spending a lot of time in this space over the years (although, to be clear, I’m still learning A LOT here; friends of mine like Ty Lingley, Ally.io’s Head of Partnerships and one of our Partner leaders at my current organization can go far deeper than I can!).Take the time to agree to this being a priority for both businesses, and get specific on how many resources will be invested by each party (“give-gets”)Co-develop clear objectives and metrics, and schedule review meetings well into the future where all key people will meet, review process, and make necessary changesTake the time to map out and segment where a product or service will be sold, and then invest the time to tailor your value points / story to speak to each segmentMake sure to invest time in market / customer research. Markets move fast, and JVs/partnerships of any kind can’t just architect a shared value prop / go-to-market plan once and then walk away. It needs to be iterated on to ensure how they’re going to market reflects the realities of the timesFor JVs in particular, it can be helpful to sometimes set a target duration for the venture. Not all business collaborations are meant to be a forever thing. I’ve seen several cases where companies do a “3-year partnership to develop X product/IP and learn about a new space)Do not skimp on legal cleanliness — make sure you involve your respective legal counsel to craft documented agreements and be crystal clear on things like revenue shareMake sure incentives are aligned to drive attention and ingenuity on both sides of the partnership. This typically means incentivizing members of a sales force going out to talk to customers, and it typically means that rewards kick in when the partnership drives a certain amount of revenue or product usageA trend over the last five years in particular  has been to focus on end-product usage and not just revenue. There are hundreds of articles on this, and over the last decade of my career ***usage*** has always been a very important metric of successI’ll add more / correct myself in six months when I write about this again :)**Section 4:**So, back to fast growth. What’s the takeaway here?To quickly gain access to and engagement with a wider set of customers than you currently have access to, consider investing in channel partnerships. Like anything else in life, you have to do your diligence to make sure to find the right partners. Not all channel partnerships are created equalJoint ventures tend to be a more intensive commitment and usually aren’t the answer to fast growth; they can, however, be a powerful way to enter an altogether new market. **Oftentimes, JVs are a precursor to a merger or acquisition — it gives you a chance to almost “test drive” what it’s like working with a team or organization**It’s critical to set clear objectives and metrics (key results) for your partnership, and to establish management mechanisms (steering committees, monthly check-ins, strategy refinement workshops, etc.) to help make sure your organizations are progressing towards achieving goalsDon’t do a “set it and forget it” motion with your shared goals — refine them, and make sure to bring in real, validated learning from customers and the market to adjust how you go to market togetherMost business leaders I know are ultimately focused on two near-term objectives: customer acquisition and revenue. So many of us (myself included!) are fighting this battle day in and day out. It usually feels like a slog, because it is one, but it doesn’t always have to be so freaking hard. I have found both JVs and Channel Partnerships to be a way to drive faster growth, and as a way to learn about many different sub-markets (geography, types  of customers and their needs) at a very fast pace, all while getting more people onto the same team, rowing in the same direction. Especially for younger companies, this can be a critical lifeline in the pursuit of early wins. But as a closing note to Part 1 here, just because these pathways exist, doesn’t mean they’re a magic bullet for growth. They are NOT a magic bullet, and to make it work it you need to prioritize it, which means investing time (which means not investing time elsewhere). You also needs to have a core/fundamental product that is ready to be adopted “at scale.” Which leads me to the final point: many companies would be better served by getting to know their customers more deeply, and carefully refining their product development and baseline sales & marketing capabilities than going through channel partners or JVs. My perspective on when to pursue one of these paths versus looking more inward for growth is coming in Part 2, because candidly I’m still answering that question myself! If you have any perspectives or good reading on this, I’d love to hear it. I am always curious, and always learning.Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis.

So, you want to get promoted? Here are some of my takeaways after 6 promotions in 10 years. Stop asking people for permission to do more. Just start doing more. Check your ego. Sometimes you actually just are not ready. If you’re the kind of person who always thinks you’re ready for the next, bigger job, maybe first ask 4-5 other people who you work with (including folks more senior/experienced than you) why you are not ready to “outperform” at the next level. There is great maturity in saying, “I’m not quite ready yet” — this is the kind of thing that many senior leaders will respect, and the self-awareness will set you apartFocus on making others around you successful. Around you = immediately around you (your team), and generally around you (your broader organization). Talk about how to improve the business and the team and the organization 90% of the time, and spend 10% of the time talking about how a change of role could play into thatProactively ask for constructive and affirmative feedback, give yourself feedback, and mercilessly prioritize learning ways to address the feedback. (closely related to point 2). This also means maintaining what’s working well.Get results. Promotions aren’t achieved by blips; they’re achieved by trends. Find ways to get the jobs handed to you done well, and do it consistently. ShareRecruit a team of mentors (ideally 5+ people) to guide you, and then have your “board” of sponsors (super mentors) (at least 3 people). (I talk about this a bunch in earlier letters that you can find here). Come to these people with tangible concepts/ideas for how you want to move forward, because it will make capturing feedback from them easier“I need for you to see the f*cking bigger picture” (letter 11) — Advancing to higher levels means that you need to think at a higher level, where you see more around you. Tactically this looks like: understanding what other teams across your company are pursuing, understanding what your competition is doing, understanding broader market trends and how they might impact your groupBe f*cking bold, and follow-up on your ideas/proposals. If you have an idea that you think could really advance your organization, then map it out over three slides (Problem, Solution, What We Should Do Next), pitch it to your boss, pitch it to your boss’s boss, pitch it to other leaders around you. Keep talking about it until you are told, “You need to stop on this, it’s not going to fly right now”Make sure you actually enjoy what you’re doing. Because if you don’t enjoy your work, then having to deal with more of it is likely to cause a degree of resentment, faster burnout, and subpar performance. Passion is infectious, and if you lack passion for what you do, those who you work with will notice, and it will likely drag down resultsMake sure the ecosystem around you knows who you are, what you do, and what your dreams are. The fact is that advancement is not some mathematical formula; it’s a factor that is deeply influenced by human emotion. And in order for anyone to feel anything about you (positive or negative) they need to first know you. Take the time to do meet and greets with counterparts at your level, “below” (ugh I hate this word in this context) you, and “above” (ugh again) you. If you’re wanting to advance in the next period of time, It’s OK to state it, but be careful about coming across as brash. “I want to get promoted in the next cycle” is maybe a bit too much; “I’ve been dialing up at work lately, am enjoying the growth, and am starting to think about gaining more responsibility…” is better. SubscribeThere’s way more to share here, and I’ll do it in a follow-up at some point in the next few months, but I do want to call out something: if your only reason for wanting to get promoted is to make more money, then you might want to re-evaluate if what you’re doing now is actually the thing that brings you joy. The attainment of money is an important and worthwhile aspect of one’s career, but if that’s all you’re going for, work will feel like just that: work, and it won’t feel like what it could be: a calling.MDShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#35 - So you want to get promoted?Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

But soon after the buzz of the accomplishment had wound down, the questions of “what comes next?” started to dial up, both from my friend-family community and my own brain.Tl;Dr — this letter is about making sure we aren’t missing really wonderful opportunities by being excessively focused on a deliberate plan and/or not taking the time to be open to more information and/or a potentially better path forward altogether.I’ve struggled with a blessing/curse of needing to have a strategy or approach to achieve “what’s next” for everything ever since, at age 15, I decided that I wasn’t going to just let life happen to me, but to do my darndest to take life by the horns and drive towards the outcomes I wanted both in my personal life and on the academic/work front.It’s been a blessing because it keeps me eyes-wide open and action-oriented. I don’t really believe in “It’ll all just work out.”  It’s a curse because you can set great goals and be excessively rigid in pursuing them, and in the discipline of driving towards achievement…completely over-think your journey. You can also be so deep in executing a plan that you miss the many solutions floating by right above, just out of your view.ShareBelow are some perspectives on how to achieve a balance between the poles of “everything must be deliberately planned…” and “eh, everything will work itself out!”:First, understand the balance between Deliberate and Emergent strategy (article from HBS here)Clayton M Christensen talks about this in his wonderful book, How Will You Measure Your Life? Deliberate strategy = deliberate sets of approaches you take in order to achieve a goal. Example: “I want to become an investment banker after college”Example: “I want to be CMO of Coca-Cola by 30!!”Example: “I will move to Paris and live there for at least two years” (…my wife and I have this as a goal for sometime later in life)Emergent strategy = what arises from unplanned actions you’ve taken. I’ll extend the academic definition to be — “the signals that are all around you that may suggest taking a different direction than what you’ve planned.” Example: Starting out a walk and planning to go to get coffee from your favorite shop, when you realize that you want a specific type of tea and there’s a tea shop you haven’t tried only another block away —> you sample the tea shopExample: Planning to stay at one company for your career so that you can achieve a certain level there, only to realize that you get deep joy and fulfillment from doing something entirely different at a different companyExample: Studying for the MCATs (med school exams) and realizing halfway through that you really actually enjoy data analytics and computer science, and so you switch paths and end up building medical analytics software (I’m talking about one of my friends; you know who you are!)Second, take some time to simply answer the question, “What signals is life / the world giving me that I should be taking a modified path”I try to answer this question across a set of dimensions. Here are a few: Health - am I healthy? Am I sleeping? Am I working out enough? Is my career enabling me to be more or less healthy?Flow at Work — how often do you feel like you’re in an enjoyable flow state? Does work feel HORRIBLE to go to? Can you not remember the last time you felt real joy and empowerment at work? (…that might be a signal to make a change)People — are the people in your life good for you and vice versa? Do you feel supported? Are you supporting the wellbeing of others? Do you get joy from your relationships? Is there a two-way street in your relationships, or are efforts just one-sided?Third, talk to other people! (or find ways to hear other perspectives)Whenever you’re approaching a potential turning point, or you have an idea around a new area you might want to explore, you should do your diligence!Talk to other people that know you, but also reach out to others whom you don’t know. Get their opinions, ask them to introduce you to others. Talk to as many people as you can to discover more about their journeys, opinions, things they love about their paths, things they don’t loveRead autobiographies on people in spaces that you are interested inListen to podcasts! If you can get into auditory learning, this is probably the most efficient way to get many different perspectives quickly. Some of my recent favorites that feature someone interviewing someone else (usually on their life, career, perspectives, etc.) are:Armchair Expert with Dax ShephardTim Ferriss ShowThe GeneralistLex Friedman Podcast (…usually 3-5 hours episodes!)Acquired (my favorite these days)Freakonomics (still goin!!)How I Built This (also still goin!!)ShareBut there are two key things I haven’t explicitly called out above that are: curiosity and patience. Having the curiosity to ask questions, and seek out color and texture on a given topic… to discover more is what will reveal different parts of the world to you. Exploration is what helps to show you what’s possible. I wrote about this a lot in #28 - Seeing What’s Possible is a Mindset Choice. And lastly, Patience is so important. Sometimes, you’re just moving too quickly (and without heavy care for details), and it can cause you to metaphorically go off the rails. Something I’ve learned from master chess players, particularly successful operators of large organizations, and studying history’s great leaders is that they know how to manage the clock — when to slow down the pace of a decision making exercise, and to allow time for more observation and consideration on their own and with others around them. …And yeah, you can be too patient and miss opportunities. There’s no consistent way to know when you’ve been too patient or too impatient. The way I’ve been trying to get better at this is simply to ask others around you. “Hey, I’m in X situation, should I act now, or should I let things sit for a little bit?”The goal of all of this is really to make sure that we aren’t missing really wonderful opportunities by being excessively focused on a deliberate plan and/or not taking the time to be open to more information and/or a potentially better path forward altogether.SubscribeShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#36: Deliberate versus Emergent Decision Making -- embracing the unplanned sparks in one's life and careerCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I was spending time helping to stand up the CCO’s office, strategic priorities, cultural goals, target state organizational model, and collaboration model with all of the other functions at the company. I’d love to be able to say the main thing I took away from that project was about market strategy or running a large organization, but it wasn’t. It was an extremely basic lesson: you should review your calendar once per month, and give yourself feedback on how you could have better allocated your time to hit your goals (both at work and at home).ShareHow to Implement This (with examples): Get your calendar out and scan for themes in how you spent your time over the last month. I usually go week-by-week and start writing out things like: 1-1s with teamsLeadership / steering committee meetingsThinking timeGrowth strategy project XAdministrative workTransformation project YWasted meetings — meetings where you sat, did nothing, ingested nothing of valueLast-minute emergenciesGet general counts — “Roughly 10 hours on project x, roughly 60 hours on 1-1s”Go into a spreadsheet, write your categories, and assign hours to themThen assign a percentage of total time to each categoryTake total core hours you worked, usually 160 (40*4), 200 (50*4) or 240 (60*4)Now, for each of the categories, add the goals you had for the last monthAnd now, go category by category and give yourself feedback (both affirmative and constructive), and keep in mind that the goal isn’t simply, “spend more time on what matters”… It’s also “optimize how you’re showing up in these categories.” This is probably the most important stepThe last thing I like to do is to go category by category and grade my overall impact. The key here is not to grade “did you spend enough time here??”, it’s to grade your impact in that category. Are you driving positive outcomes through your 1-1s? Are you showing up effectively in meetings? Closing ThoughtsEach time I do this, my categories have looked slightly different, and I’ve only ONCE given myself an A (out of probably 12 times of doing this?). Ideally you do it once per month, but in reality once per quarter probably makes the most sense. If you want to improve your impact at work, where you spend your time and how you show up during those times will make a massive impact on your team/org, and also the pace at which you grow in your career.

My responsibility during this phase was to, among other things: Come up with a communications strategy for things like philanthropy, climate positions, corporate responsibility, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion)Understand histories and perspectives of other global leaders attending (…this took forever)Develop a framework of talking points that all key attendees follow to influence how the community thinksI can’t take credit for achieving all of the above — there was a team of 5-10 people working on all of this, but I had the chance to jump across each of the above three dimensions, and point 3 was really where the “rubber hit the road” so to speak. In this situation, I learned the importance of re-communication and have consistently said the following to the teams I’ve worked with:  Effective communications isn’t saying something once and hoping it sticks. It’s saying it over and over again, across channels and interaction points until your target population can say the points back to you with extremely high accuracy.Talking points help with making sure your communications are effective.ShareWhy Talking Points Matter: Preparation enables success, and if you have many people helping to push an agenda or initiative, they all need to be speaking from the same fundamental ideasThis doesn’t mean everyone necessarily saying the exact same things verbatim as if reading from a piece of paper — it means people being consistent and also putting their own flair on the pointsWithout clear talking point guidance, leaders and representatives will sway from core messages, and can cause confusion or outright undermine whatever communication points existEnter “The Communications PhalanxI wrote a way-too-long post about the power of a Classics major in #33, so it should be zero surprise that I’m bringing in a term from ancient history: the phalanx. The phalanx is an ancient Greek tactical formation that, “consists of a block of heavily armed infantry standing shoulder to shoulder in files several ranks deep.” (Brittanica definition). This tactic was utterly game-changing in helping to win countless battles, and I think it’s a wonderful analogy (…violence notwithstanding of course) for how a group of individuals on the same team should think about how they communicate a set of messages to an audience. This is a term I’ve used in my brain for a long time (and at work).Look at the above image. Each person occupies a different part of the plane — no one person makes the exact same steps and yet they are coordinated. They move in unison, but they step on different parts of the land in front of them. This is how a highly effective leadership team or organization creates change in their chosen area of focus. Thus, a definition: the communications phalanx is a tactical device that organizations can utilize to drive impactful, coordinated communication and re-communication. I built out this somewhat-crappy graphic to explain how to think about a comms phalanx.(yeeeeesh, so many arrows. I’ll explain it now).ShareUnderstanding the pyramid graphic above: Skip past this section if you feel like you get the main idea.DefinitionsPyramid = the total addressable market space for your messageOriginal Communicators (OCs) = The people and places where a message is being delivered from firstInitial Target Population (ITPs) = The first population of people who are hearing a message Secondary Populations (SPs) = The people who hear a message second-hand or somewhat unintentionallyDynamics1. Messages start from the OCs and the flow down to the ITPs and then ITPs communicate what they understand / surmise about the original message2. Typically from ITPs to SPs is when there is signal loss. It’s when the original message gets interpreted and potentially warped —> leads to confusion 3. Feedback then flows back up through the pyramid, reaching the original communicators, who then have the opportunity to refine and clarify their message before then communicating once again through the pyramidIf the original communicators do not get feedback on how the message is landing, they will not increase their effectiveness. The best way to make this happen is to have a multi-point strategy whereby they: 1. Get direct feedback from the second layer (ITPs) on what is and is not landing 2. Skip layers and go directly to the secondary population to get their thoughts (Example: CEO of coca-cola going to the plant floor and asking employees what they want to see changed instead of going to their SVPs/VPs and asking)3. Have an industrialized way to capture feedback like regular surveys, social listening, etc.Example Applications Leadership teams driving change managementAgreeing on a set of talking points, ensuring all leaders know the 3-5 power points, and make sure to talk about the points in their respective org meetings, team meetings, and even 1-1s, and then making sure the team takes time to report back on what they’re hearing from people receiving their messagesCategory creationDefining a set of crisp talking points that you will use to create a new market space. Let’s go through an example… how about… Cookie Grading (Hey, Exonomist is STILL written in raw form, which means my analogies are going to be, at times, absurd). Example points: We love cookies, and we love the artistry of a tasty, symmetrical cookieYou love posting your cookie pictures to social, and your friends love seeing themDon’t you want a device that helps you ensure your cookies are perfectly round and plump? We have a new app, 360 Cookie, that gives you augmented reality guides to help you craft the perfectly instagrammable cookieCheck out 360cookie.com (please don’t go to this site, I don’t know what’s there — I hope it’s not inappropriate or computer-ruining)Political party driving an agenda itemPolitical parties have used this approach for centuries, and you can see it today by simply turning on the news after any major issue arises and you see multiple politicians using the same term but speaking to the topic with their own localized flair, in a way that ideally lines up with their constituency And perhaps in no place is the feedback loop more important — politicians use feedback from media and constituents to understand how a message is landing, and they pile on when something is working Which leads me to a risk of this tactic… Like all powerful things, tactics/technologies can be mis-used. I’ve unfortunately seen this at play for many years by various political parties and movements across the globe who just mercilessly push a message, but then fail to / choose not to come back and refine their pointsWhich leads me to a closing thought about feedback cycles in communications. Sometimes you’ll discover that your points aren’t working and that you need to adjust them… And in some cases, you might find that your points are landing but causing rancor / discord. It is in these cases that people should carefully process feedback they’re getting together as a team and align on the best path forward not only for their organization but for the population the messages are intended for. So where does this leave us? Here are some bottom-line thoughts: Embrace the communications phalanx and take the time to actually write out your 3-5 talking points for a give pursuit While I’ve talked about this in terms of larger groups, you can also utilize it in smaller ones too. Try actually writing out the three ideas you want your organization to adopt, and then start sharing it in every/most of your conversations. You’ll be surprised what can happen after you say the same points to 3, 4, or 5 people, and how suddenly things you said are being uttered by people very far removed from you (…or your idea wasn’t that original and you’re just piling on — who knows)Take time to capture feedback…extract it, if you must, from the people around you. Don’t assume they will talk to you; make the time to go to them and approach whatever they tell you — no matter how brutal — with curiosity and not contemptShareThanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

It is something that has to be nurtured in order to remain wise…effective…helpful. A couple of months ago, I was at a start-up founder happy hour, which also happened to have a bunch of advisors and VCs in attendance. One of the advisors there, let’s call him Sam, entered a conversation circle that was talking about marketing tactics. Sam, who worked in investment banking for most of his 40-year+ career, started giving “feedback” to a founder in the group, saying something along the lines of, “Listen, from my experience, the only tried and true way I’ve seen early marketing work is to literally pick up the phone and call all of your prospects until they finally pick up and have to listen to you. You need to make them listen to you. Don’t take No for an answer. And for fuck’s sake, don’t waste your money on trade shows and “webinars”… since when has that actually worked?Sam did this thing that I have always found deeply irritating: over-leveraging his relatively narrow bound of experience, and not showing any modicum of awareness about the limits of his expertise… or the curiosity to expand or sharpen his base of knowledge. He was also just rude and condescending… But, you know, he had a lot of experience… …Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareIt’s not that his advice was 100% wrong; it wasn’t. In some situations, his approach may have been the approach to take, but for most his audience of under-40 B2B founders who’ve grown up in a very different, digital-first world, where growth oftentimes come from hybrid marketing strategies (in-person, digital, webinars, co-marketing efforts, paid media, etc.) his advice was not very additive. The eye rolls said as much.You see, Wisdom Fades. It is something that has to be nurtured in order to remain, well, wise…effective…helpful. You cannot assume that your experience or perspective will always be the “key” to someone else’s situation. You need to lead with curiosity, ask questions, understand their context, share ideas, get feedback, tune your recommendations, and so onWe should always the time to understand where our areas of expertise are versus where we simply have exposure or some quality experience. Expertise, in my view, means that you are top 5% in the world at a given topic, that you’ve likely seen hundreds (if not thousands) of variations on scenarios within your topic, that you’ve been wrong A LOT, and that you can, through light questioning, quickly uncover patterns to help you ask increasingly potent and enlightenment-inducing questionsThe world is always-evolving. Many people seem to think that the world has changed at a faster pace than almost ever before in the last 20 years, and the speed of information + technological evolution seems to be sustaining that pace. This implies that tactics and strategies that may have worked in 1995 or even 2005…or even 2018…19…20…21… (you see where I’m going?) might not work anymore!This means that even if you have great depth in an area, your base of knowledge is almost always being undermined and diminished by the speed of how the world moves around youThis all means that the only way to remain relevant and effective is to constantly be learning new things and refining your ideas about how your part of the world works and who will own the futureAnd tactically, when you hear a strategy or tactic that your gut reaction is to disagree with, practice taking a few seconds to flex your brain and consider how something could work… And if you can’t understand why, then ask how it works, under what circumstances it is optimal, and/or when it doesn’t applyExample: Landing pages with quickly-available “Call Sales” buttons are the best way to drive early-stage growthQuestion 1: Are there situations when this isn’t optimal? Answer: Yes, when you have a product-led growth business that has chosen to keep a minimal sales team in place that is already overwhelmed… And/or the company has chosen to focus not on Enterprise sales growth pathways, but instead on 1-to-1 sales (i.e., getting one person to become a customer, not an entire company)Question 2: When should a company use this tactic?Answer: … Why am I even writing anymore? ChatGPT can answer this question…See below:I think this general idea of your experience not always being relevant was touched on quite well (and succinctly) in a recent 20VC episode with Jeff Katzenberg (former Chairman of The Walt Disney Co., co-founder and CEO of DreamWorks Animation, and now General Partner at VC firm WndrCo). He talked about how “operating experience becomes irrelevant fast” given how quickly markets, technologies, and even human behavior changes. I’ve embraced this reality, and it leads me to very deliberately seek out many different opinions on topics, and it also leads me to state, explicitly, when I do or do not have unique insight / expertise in a given topic area. The colleagues and founders I work with should hopefully be able to corroborate this :-) (…and if I’m full of shit, please call me out on it).Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

There's A Better Way...Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareTwo letters in two days, whatttttt (this isn’t normal). Hope you enjoy today’s read, hopefully in time for your 2023 goal setting processes. Also, if you find the GIFs annoying, please tell me. I promise I do GIF a damn. ….Letter Flow: I think annual resolutions on their own are not effective for most people (with research)Embrace quarterly goalsYou don’t have unlimited bandwidthBe reasonable about the number of goals you set (the better way)What you achieve today lays the foundation for what you can achieve tomorrow1. I think annual resolutions on their own are not effective for most peopleWe’re heading into 2023 soon, and I want to share something I think is bullshit for most human beings: annual resolutions. I have long had an antagonistic relationship to the annual resolution, because I don’t think most people are actually wired to pursue most 1-year goal. It can be both near-term enough to allow procrastination and far-away enough to not inspire bold action.…Counterargument: you can say this about anything…but moving on, what does the research say?Study #1: 44% of participants have been likely or very likely to make a New Year’s resolution for the coming year (University of Stockholm)Study #1: Out of 1066 randomized participants, 55% considered themselves successful in “sustaining” their goalStudy #2: 80% of New Years Resolutioners fail by the end of February (Forbes)Context here is people going to the gym, and I should also note that Forbes was very vague on sources / research, so I would say take this one with a grain of saltStudy (Poll) #3:  49% of people who made resolutions actually stuck to them (across categories, which include exercise, finances, career, etc.)OK, so generally speaking people do not achieve the annual goals they set. Research outcomes vary by category (fitness goals vs career goals, for example), but the fact is that many people set annual resolutions, and then proceed to not achieve them. So what do we do here?Subscribe2. Embrace quarterly-goalsAbove, I made the assertion that most people aren’t wired to pursue annual goals, and I think I could probably be a bit more clear and say that: most people have a limit to the number of goals they can reasonably expect to achieve. You’re a busy person! You’ve got a lot going on. You’re doing (that is, accomplishing) a lot every day. A.k.a doin’ the damned thang.So, when you set more goals, you’re just adding to the list of things you have to do. And if you don’t also remove when you add, you’ll probably find yourself burning out (See: “#28: Funnel Like It’s Hot, and Why Saying No…”).And thus, a logical next-step statement:We should embrace setting goals on a shorter time horizon than a year. These quarterly goals should build up to an annual goal or goals, however. This is how most organizations function, and it’s for a reason. If you were a major shareholder in a publicly-traded company, how would you feel if you only got a status report once a year? Probably not great (at least I wouldn’t), and who is a bigger shareholder in your life than you? Embracing quarterly goals allows you to understand if you are veering of track faster, and to make corrections / adjustments to your goals earlier. But there’s still one more thing you need to be wary of with annual goal setting…Share3. You don’t have unlimited bandwidthI’ve come across many people who ascribe to this whole notion of hustle culture. I have a bit of a problem with the underlying idea of hustle culture. My issue is not that some people want to go the extra mile (or ten) in an endeavor, it’s that it’s too narrow in scope (mainly, work/career) and not sustainable (over years) for most. AND if you’re hustling in one area of your life, you’re probably not also hustling in other areas. That is to say, there are tradeoffs we have to make. You can’t “burn the candle at both ends” for too long, or else you’ll start to face other issues (family life falling apart, health issues, “workism (see Atlantic article). I can’t remember which CEO I heard say that, in startups particularly, you can pick two of: Family, Friends, or Your Startup, but not all three. There’s probably some wisdom here.Counterargument: sometimes you need to burn the candle at both ends to achieve great things. My counterpoint to the counterargument: be honest about what you can actually handle, and you should also place a time limit on how long you’ll dial up or dial down your degree of hustle. You must manage your bandwidth to be effective in your life, whether it’s at home or at work (Damn, I still need to write that post on Energy Management. Been talking about it for a year. Maybe will do that next week)4. Be reasonable about the number of goals you setIf you’re one of the founders that I have the privilege of working with in some capacity, my reminder to you is: you are more than your company and that the price of building something great shouldn’t be the destruction of your family / health.If you’re a non-founder human like most of us, then you should also take stock of all that you need to do in your life before you commit to something ridiculous like the below…Bad Goal-Setting Example: Michael’s Resolutions from 2015 (the last year I did annual resolutions on their own): Make senior consultant in one year (context: this was extremely aggressive) (did not achieve)Complete a triathlon (Ha. definitely did not achieve)Build MVP of new technology platform (do wireframes count? did not achieve)Nurture new / budding relationships in NYC (achieved - some of my closest friends in the world come from this time)Critique: WHAT A JOKE. I mean…these goals are all very time/energy intensive. When you set goals, you should consider the LOE (level of effort) required to achieve them. Let me dig into how ridiculous this set of goals was:Making Senior Consultant in one year would’ve required near-complete obsession about client work, and the politics around work tooTriathlon training requires an obscene amount of training, sleep, nutrition, etc. — all things that get sacrificed wen you’re going for a rapid promo at work in a consulting firmMVP for a new tech platform… This all takes a long time. Even IF you were like I was and very very fast at UI design and concept creation, you’d still need to have the time and/or resources to build software, oversee others coding things you couldn’t etc. Making friends is freaking hard, and nurturing means seeing / communicating regularly, which itself takes energy!Ultimately, I chose to prioritize this because I realized that my friendships were providing the most joy and growth. I learned and grew in incredible ways thanks to my friendships. Over the year, I realized that the other goals just weren’t feasible or that important for me, so I dropped them and prioritized ONE.Better goal setting looks like: setting two to three annual goals, and also take the time (hell, just 5 to 10 minutes per goal even) to map out the milestones you want to achieve throughout each period of time (whether they’re monthly milestones or every 2 or 3 months). Here are my goals from two years ago: First, behavioral remindersPrioritize rest. You have a default “on” state. Practice slowing your brain down, and achieving rejuvenationSet strong limits at work to avoid time creep; embrace brutal prioritizationAccept that you will not be able to please everyone. Let some relationships dial down to less frequent or no communicationBe in the moment more. Multi-task less.

They’re building on what has not worked in the past tooThe “Reach” goal assumes that I won’t make progress, and gets ahead of what I need to do when I invariably want to give upI have a three-month milestones for every goal to help me check-in before it’s December again hahaThese goals were all achieved, and then some :-). And the achievements of then play a really important role for Today and Tomorrow…5. Laying foundations for your futureWhen you are reasonable about the goals you set, you’re more likely to make sustainable progress. When you make sustainable progress, you’re giving yourself a metaphorical step on the ladder towards whatever place you want to go in your life. I would rather take one quality step, and one quality step, and one quality step than try to jump three rungs and fall off the ladder all together. What you achieve today lays the foundation for both what you can achieve tomorrow *and* the fulfillment you might find on the journey to “tomorrow.” And for all the time we spend thinking about tomorrow, we owe it to ourselves to find regular joy in today, too.(also, falling off ladders is f*cking painful. Not something I enjoy doing, and YES I have fallen off of a ladder before — hurt my confidence, and my bottom)Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis.

In most situations at work and in more personal group settings, there is limited time. Therefore, the more you talk, the less others can. Watching your air time is an easy way to make sure others enjoy being around you, and that you’re maximizing your learning together.Air time is the amount of time you spend taking up the “air” (conversational space) in a conversation. Like oxygen in a chamber, there is a limited amount of air time available, and yet many people seem to not appreciate this scarcity of space and time. While there are many scenarios where air time mgmt. is not necessary or helpful, you should generally be aware of it when spending time with others… if only because it can be rude to dominate conversations.Here’s the flow for today’s short letter: Why does air time management matter?Some signs of poor air time management Ways to better manage your own air time, and the air time of othersMy personal take on air time management + specific tactics to be more inclusive (You’ve definitely been the person on the right at some point, haven’t you?)1. Air time management matters because…People have limited attention spans and tend to stop paying attention when you ramble on and on and onTypically the more you talk, the less someone else is communicating (verbally) to you… Meaning you could be crowding out their opportunity to share, connect, and inform you + othersIt can be downright annoying to be captive in a conversation that you can’t leaveGetting a reputation for dominating conversations is dangerous to your career and your social life The more you talk, the more self-oriented / self-centered you may come across 2. You might not be managing your time when…You can’t answer the questions “how is this person doing?” or “What is their POV on this topic?” after you’ve been in the conversation for ten minutesPeople are just nodding over and over while you talk, but not saying anythingYou haven’t asked any questions of othersWhen there is repeated silence every time you finish talkingPeople start making less eye contact with youNote: some people aren’t big on overly intense eye contact. You can make too much eye contact (aka laser beams). Anyways, take this one with a grain of salt3. How to get better at air time management Let me start by saying that this has absolutely been a development area for me in the past (and invariably we all have times when we deviate and talk talk talk talk talk), but there are some things I’ve done over the years to very intentionally make sure to always keep conversations (including and almost especially in my personal life). Here’s what I’ve done: Literally try to keep a general “heat map” of group conversations. It’ll rarely be perfectly balanced (and it doesn’t always need to be), but you should make sure that every person at the table / meeting has had an opportunity to contribute at least 2 or 3 times. Give people the option to participate less, don’t make the decision for them by crowding them out / not asking any questions.Have someone hold you (and others) accountable. In a work context, this might mean someone to facilitate the meeting or “help us make sure we’re running on time”…who has permission to tell someone, “This is a great discussion, but we need to move along to the next topic given the time we have remaining.”Prioritize a curiosity mindset. Instead of just waiting to say what’s on your brain, lead with questions. Actively try to answer the question, “What is every person here thinking about this topic?” In a personal context, this means making sure that if you’re in a group conversation you have actively tried to involve others in the group around you. It doesn’t need to be a checklist of just arbitrarily trying to hear from everyone around you, but people appreciate being heard, and when you help pull them into conversations oftentimes they will remember you for your thoughtfulness and genuine interest in their viewWork out your listening muscle. Practice going to conversations with the intent of listening as much as you can. Critically, this does not mean just asking questions and smiling + nodding. It means that your responses seek to build upon / add to what you are hearing. One of my favorite things to say (shout out to my former client Julie) is simply: “Say more (about that)…” in a warm toneVisualize the warmth others feel when they are heard and validated. Empowering others to be included and to contribute feels awesomeSubscribe4. My personal take: managing your air time is the foundation of healthy relationships, both at work and at homeI started really thinking about this topic after two things happened: Years ago, I got feedback on a project that I was dominating meetings (I was in a phase of trying to prove that I could be a strong leader and was just f*cking dominating team meetings to an annoying extent. Ew, past Michael!)There was a friendship that let fade specifically because every time this person and I spoke, they literally never asked a single thing about my life. We would be on the phone for an hour, we would talk about this person’s life + challenges etc., and then every time at the 55th or 60th minute they would say, “well i’m glad we’re both doing well!” …and I’m like, how the hell would you know?After I kept thinking on this, I started going really deep into: how to create inclusive relationships at work and at home, and came across the monicker that goes something like: diversity means everyone has a seat at the table, and inclusion means that everyone has a voice (or something like that). It stuck with me, and changed the way I think about spending time with other people. I’ll close with some calls to action for you:When you’re at a happy hour for work, bring in other people to your conversations. It super sucks to not be included When you’re in your next work meeting, make sure every single person in the meeting has either spoken at least once or had ample opportunities to contribute (and if you can’t feasibly do that…maybe your meeting is too large?”)Make a point of being able to answer “How is this person doing?” and “what is their point of view on this topic (being discussed)?”But monitor for signs of someone not wanting to engageIf you really struggle with this, wear a watch, and glance down at it before you start talking, and glance down every so often to make sure too much time hasn’t passedPersonal note: I do this at work, especially when covering topics I feel passionate about. Eventually you’ll develop a natural sense for, “i’ve been talking for 45 seconds…”This is also critical when giving presentations. The best presentations aren’t long monologues, they are punchy points delivered as part of an easy-to-follow story, with lots of dialogue (exception: things like TED talks)If you feel like you’re talking too much, you just might be… I am pretty sure I had at least two meetings in December where I realized that I had been talking for over 75 seconds and just said, “team, sorry. Lots of words. Let me try to bottom-line this succinctly: (insert point / question)And again, there are exceptions. If you’re doing a “state of our business” presentation, then yeah: you’re probably going to be talking for 5-10 minutes. As with all things, context matters. In closing, my most joyful relationships are ones where both people feel engaged and heard. My most fulfilling groups are the ones where everyone is heard, and growing together. I think it is so important to make sure you’re doing little things to make the experiences others have around you more pleasant, because we deserve to feel heard and to learn from others around us. Managing your air time is a foundational element of making sure others actually enjoy spending time with you.MichaelThank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis.

I also think I probably didn’t spend enough time talking about the scenarios where air time management is important, and how to discern the difference. It’s touched on, but …feels like there’s a layer or two more needed. I also don’t know if some things I do — like the “heat map” thing — are feasible / easy-to-implement for others?…Hell, I am certainly not perfect at it...But then again it doesn’t need to be perfect — it’s supposed to just…directionally help you ensure you aren’t totally ignoring / crowding out someone.Additionally, the tone feels slightly-acidic sometimes here, and that’s not really my tone of voice… So there’s some dissonance between my warmth-as-a-default approach to interpersonal relationships and the snark of writing about how annoying it is to be captive to the monologues of another human.  … Omg wait, is this letter a monologue? Is Exonomist one giant f*cking monologue??? …Maybe need to pivot into YouTube interviewing or something more…two-way. Also, I am now thinking about two more conversations I had in December (introductory, get-to-know-each other calls), where I most certainly spoke for 4-5 minutes straight and am now feeling a tinge of discomfort. … You live and you learn!Welp, will probably come back and re-write this letter when I start mapping out my eventual book.

Per week? How many meetings have you left feeling motivated…inspired… energized? Probably not too many…Which leads me to a proclamation: meetings do not have to suck!When done right, a well-prepared-and-run meeting can completely change the trajectory of a relationship… project… business… and even industry.Given the potential held up in these hallmarks of modern corporate life, it makes sense that we would at least try to be excellent at meetings (both as a meeting leader and participant).So to help here, I’m going to write out some ideas on how to avoid having crappy meetings as well as some specific tactics to help empower excellent, game-changing meetings. These lists are NOT anywhere near exhaustive, but they are some of the things that are top of mind. …And full disclosure: we’re all still working on this. I’ve been particularly inconsistent about at least two of the points below lately.SubscribeEight Characteristics of Ineffective MeetingsBelow are some things to avoid and strive for, respectively, as you pursue your own personal… apex of effectiveness (man I love the word “apex”) in meetings. :-) No objective or goal for the time is definedAlternative wording: vaguely defined problem statement / improvement opportunityThe amount of time scheduled lacks intentionExample: just scheduling 60 minutes without thinking through how exactly the time will be usedStakeholders not managing their air time (see #42 Managing Your Air Time, published last month)No clear leader to help keep the group focused + engagedLack of a pre-read or preview of sortsFull disclosure: these days I am horrible about this. A bit difficult when you have a really heavy meeting schedule, but it’s still a very good practice for meetings that require a big decision to be made and/or a touch point with someone who is particularly high-up in a companyLack of attention to meeting attendee selection (take the time to make sure every stakeholder either adds and/or receives high value from the time)Ambiguity around the nature of the meeting — is it a brainstorming meeting? An information-sharing meeting? Is it a decision-making meeting? Depending on the goal, the way you set an agenda could be radically different Example Brainstorm Meeting Agenda 5 minutes: intro and quiet reading time on pre-read materials 15 minutes: developing questions to answer and/or known dependencies 30 minutes: on concept ideation 5 minutes: next stepsExample Decision-Making Meeting Agenda3 minutes: intro and quiet reading time5 minutes: overview of strategic options15 minutes: focused discussion for option 115 minutes: focused discussion for option 25 minutes: preliminary ranking of each option’s supportRemaining time: aligning on a decision + next step developmentBeing excessively beholden to an agendaWhat would happen if your car’s GPS told you to turn left, only for you to discover that said turn no longer exists and is now a wall. Do you drive into it? Just like you respond to changes in your environment every day, you should also be prepared to respond to changes in how a meeting is evolving Maybe your decision-making meeting reveals that there’s a whole other third or fourth option that was previously uncovered? If that’s the case, perhaps you pivot the time to exploring alternative options + setting up next steps instead of just charging ahead for the “sake of our timeline…for the sake of our plan” (in the words of a former manager of mine)                                                         (Don’t be this person)Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareSeven Advanced Meeting Management TacticsAvoiding the above pitfalls are not, by themselves, ways to create great meetings. But here are some things I’ve seen lead to wonderfully effective meetings. Some of these may seem obvious, but I think putting this all into practice is where it can become more complex.De-risk disagreement. If you set the expectation that every meeting has to go smoothly, you’ll never experience the messiness that oftentimes comes from great ideation & decision making. Create a safe space for more intense discussion and disagreementTo take advantage of this, you need to have invested time into culture building, and ideally your team/org values touch on this. For example, our team at Ally.io had this thing called “challenge culture” where it was expected that you would openly (and politely) speak up when you had a position counter to someone else’sUse technology to maximize inclusion / engagement. Example: if you have a word doc or powerpoint / g slides presentation, build in time during your meetings for people to quietly read and leave comments live in the doc. It helps make sure EVERYONE has time to orient around a topic and that everyone has an opportunity to CONTRIBUTEBe clear about timeline to reinforce urgency. You know your company is marching towards its death when you stop moving with a sense of urgency. One way to always reinforce reasonably-fast action is to make sure to reiterate WHEN the outcome of your meeting(s) must become tangible Example: “This project is intended to run for 4 weeks, with X outcome. We are targeting seeing this implemented to customers within 8 weeks, and I know there are some concerns about how to move so quickly. Let’s talk about those concerns today.”“Anchor Back” to the Strategy. Never lose sight of the overarching goals your team / working group is trying to drive. And every meeting you have should at least briefly draw the connection back to what you’re hoping to accomplish. Example: “Our top goal is to drive faster customer conversion this month, and the goal of this time is for us to refine the 5 tactics XY team has developed to help drive this goal” Doing this will help you keep everyone focused when they suggest things that may go off topic or not be timelyEmbrace “one-slide overviews” — people don’t typically like sitting through 20-slide presentations. Reducing things to the absolute minimum # of slides / amount of content will allow people to retain more. Retention —> Understanding —> Application. Supporting retention will help you optimize for the downstream factors of Understanding (how well someone understands a topic), and Application (someone’s ability to utilize understanding to create new things or make other valuable contributions to a project / conversation)Before you hold a meeting, if possible try to get 1-1 time with every attendee first. Having a relationship with folks around the table gives you a deeper understanding around how to balance their perspectives and needs. Hell, it will help you make sure you allow them to bring their best selves to the meetingSometimes this isn’t feasible. When it isn’t, make sure you have it with whoever the key stakeholders areLastly, manage your tone carefully. Your tone is probably the single most powerful factor in how others around you will feel. Authenticity is a very powerful thing, and there are also times when that means being vulnerable. …But be careful to let high vulnerability be confused for lack of balance or self-control. I’ll probably write a letter at some point about leaders I’ve seen do a wonderful job navigating organizations through very difficult times… We’re certainly living through some right now (wars, pandemic, economic uncertainty, a new wave of technological disruption)  This is one of those topics that could literally have a book written about it, and there’s so much I did not cover above, but if you’re looking for ways to level-up your performance in meetings, hopefully the above points help you get even 1% better.

These layoffs have happened amidst a potentially-Cambrian moment for artificial intelligence technology in particular. 2023 is turning out to be the year of ChatGPT (or maybe just the Q1 of GPT…) and also the year of tech “right-sizing” as many pundits are calling it. This simultaneity can be odd to process. You have: A new technological paradigm beginning to install itself in our markets and cultureMacroeconomic tumult amidst global wars which are leading to an era of RIFs (reductions in force) andSocietal challenges (i.e., climate, housing affordability / COL, aging populations, educational quality) that could undermine the long-term growth prospects of the United States (and many other countries contending with the same challenges) [will cover in future letter]Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeHow do we think through this? Let me start with a lightweight framework from Carlota Perez, a deeply-respected academic who wrote this book I’m currently reading called Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages. In the book, Carlota posits this way to think about new technologies:It’s usually not possible to really define what was a “big bang” until much time has passed, allowing you to properly weight the significance of an innovation. But I think the rise of generative pre-trained transformer technology (a.k.a. GPT, made almost-household famous by ChatGPT). It’s quite possible that we are in the early inning of an installation period right now. As installation transitions into full-on deployment, many news jobs will be created. They will be staffed up by many people who’s prior jobs were eliminated or rendered irrelevant by the rise of GPT technology (and other types of artificial intelligence tech). These times are almost always scary for people. Even for people (like me!) who tend to view new technological paradigms as times of great opportunity, we have to acknowledge that disruption is painful. A golden age for some is a dark period for others.But let’s go back to that part about “times of great opportunity”Many people who have more experience in the world than I do seem to think that this is a time of great opportunity, particularly for innovation. Out of the many hundreds of companies that have conducted large reductions in force, many very capable people are suddenly on the job market. Many of these people harbored or nurtured entrepreneurial dreams, and as the search for a traditional job yields sub-par options or no options at all, they’ll consider building. They’ll dream of creating something of their own.But dreams are not a strategy.  To dare to dream is not in itself sufficient to lead to results. You also need to dare to experiment, constantly. There’s a joy in viewing things are experiments, because it (at least in my experience) helps to you to remain more objective. As a personal note, I tend to view learning new skills as constant experimenting, because it keeps me focused on improving + significantly reduces how shitty it feels to “lose” constantly. I’ve long done this at work, and I think experimentation should flow from the Person all the way to a company. And the companies that constantly experiment are the companies that will discover the future, and they just might own it, too.Companies as experiments  Whether you are a startup or a mature company, it’s helpful to think about much of what you do as an experiment. From my work with many organizations whose products we use every day, many of them think in bets and monitor bets via experiments. And good experiments have a timeline…They have variables you’re controlling for…They have review periods throughout to monitor the pace of change for select variables…They expect degrees of failure and focus on what was learned from failures They quickly design + run additional experiments to keep the Rate of Learning (RoL) highIt is no accident than many of the most beloved companies in the world are constantly A/B testing different aspects of their experience. It’s because a wise manager never assumes that the current state is good enough; you should always be mercilessly charging forward to extract even 1% improvements to improve your customer experience (and yes, that also means internal customers a.k.a employees).Examples of company-level experiments  This one is controversial but common: allowing multiple teams to work on the same opportunity space, to have multiple horses in the race, so to speak.There’s a reason many sci-fi movies about humans escaping earth and searching for a new home almost always feature MULTIPLE space ships…Rapidly standing-up a new, MVP product and doing an “early release” program with a set of very early customers who want to be on the cutting edgeAnd then getting their feedback constantly to refine the experience, including biz model Note: this is a great way to test if you want to make a change across the board of your product while managing riskForging a strategic joint venture (see letter #34 on joint ventures and channel partnerships) as a way to quickly add a capability to your offerings that you can take to market An on-theme-with-this-letter example is the Microsoft + OpenAI joint venture / exclusive partnershpi (btw, I swear this isn’t a Microsoft blog; no one from our marketing team approves / really cares about my writing as of now :D)Conducting minor (read: not major) re-orgs to give talented people an opportunity to thrive in a different context. Just because someone was hired into one role doesn’t mean it’s still the optimal role. Sometimes the “company-level” experiment is moving a senior leader and their team to a different part of the company, and seeing what happens. Yes, this causes a lot of disruption, and has a surprisingly low success rate (for more, read HBR’s 2016 article Getting Reorgs Right. I remember reading that on a plane…whilst going through a reorg). Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareExperiments, like innovation, can be incremental or transformationalAs you think about the set of experiments a company is making, you’ll want to make sure you’re covering the range of possibility. In other words, your experiment portfolio should be testing incremental changes as well as transformational ones. This, btw, is one of the bedrocks of innovation consulting — categorizing “bets” into categories.A good example of incremental innovation is: Spotify making their Concerts feature easier to discover (Spotify team, this feature is still so buried! It’s probably for a reason, but come onnnn)An example of transformational innovation is: Netflix completely pivoting from sending DVDs in the mail to standing up a world-class cloud infrastructure + licensing and content creation capability to own an entirely different market (streaming).Some would argue Netflix isn’t transformational innovation. To placate those people, I will give yet another example: SpaceX. SpaceX has innovated in countless categories, including especially rocket construction, and their ability to have rocket boosters land again (to drive re-usability) is a classic example of a transformational innovation. No one else on the market (except for maybe those aliens we haven’t yet discovered near Alpha Centauri ;-) ) had gotten even close to landing (ehh…Ehhhh!) that maneuver. SpaceX stacked innovation on top of innovation to create something both functional and inspiring. Winning companies “stack” innovations to grow their competitive moatsThe companies we rely on today largely have stacked many successful experiments (“innovations”) on top of one another to create entirely new types of experience. Uber “stacked” innovations like ordering a car from your phone, leveraging GPS for both the driver and rider, assigning a rating in this particular type of two-sided marketplace, all while building and improving its matching algorithm. Any one of these innovations could have been its own product, but it was when they were all stacked together that it turned into an unstoppable beast of a company. … And when you stack innovations together in a user-friendly way, you earn the right and trust of your customers to give you a shot on your next set of innovations. Apple taking the trust and design love from Mac to iPhone. iPhone product trust helped lead to a successful introduction of the Apple Watch… and Air Pods…and now probably their XR headset in late ‘23 or ‘24… And before you know it a company owns the entire “product ecosystem” around a use case…Note: I learned about product ecosystems when I worked at Doblin, Monitor Deloitte’s innovation / design consultancyIt’s the companies that make bets…experiment…uncover innovations and then stack them that will find value across the life cycle of technological revolutions… From the installation all the way through the deployment phase (see graphic above from Carlota Perez’s book). And for those who are trying to uncover the next big thing…the next company to invest in…the next company to go and work for, it can be helpful to think about: Is this company working on an incremental or transformational innovation?How mature is this market? Is it still in the installation period (characterized by market-making and many small or medium-sized competitors), or is it in the deployment period (characterized by market-taking and fierce competition among established players)How susceptible is what I’m doing to technological disruption? If you’re working in a highly creative, strategic, revenue-generating job, you’re going to be harder to displaceIf you’re working in a job that is repetitive in nature and/or relatively low in complexity, bear in the mind the pressure to automate away the job itselfHow can my current company (or companies I’m working with) take advantage of the market changes that are happening? …Maybe you can be the one to explore this, and run the experiments to find out how to take advantage.Share Exonomist by Michael DavisShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#44 - Companies as Experiments Amid Bubbles & Golden Ages Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

We spend all this time (read: $$$) developing a vision (what we want to make happen) and then outlining a strategy (how we will do it), but there are these other enabling factors that can make a break your strategy. Here’s the framework to help you track these enabling factors + talking points (below). In the spirit of Exonomist being raw, I just rebuilt whatever I had in my notepad and am not going to clean things up or enhance the framework any further. I’m going to publish this letter, and come back in a future letter and critique + improve it. Some work is needed but I think it’s a nice starting point to formulate a plan to implement a new business strategy.If you dig this graphic, consider sharing it :) or exploring the other 40+ letters I’ve written for youShareHere are the talking points:Enable Your Business Strategy to have Max Impact By Thinking Through… (V1)Communications Platforms: where you communicate with your organization and colleagues. Can be thought about as comprising “digital platforms” (e.g., Teams, Slack) and in-person environments (offsites, office, etc.)Behavioral Norms: how people work together. What are the cultural values that underpin how people treat one another… And what are the specific ways that people prefer to function (i.e., Ways of Working). Examples of this latter category might be: “At Bridgewater Associates, we reserve 5 minutes at the end of a key decision-making meeting to provide feedback to one another on how we could have done better”Language Systems: The terms that come to be company-specific or commonly used. Typically the acronyms that are utilized, the associations with words. For example, at one of my prior employers, the word “riff” meant to “riff with one another” as in: brainstorming. The moment I said that word in a startup environment, people panicked because to some people “rif” means reduction in force. Insight Management: how you capture insights and then do something with them. When a strategy is being implemented, it is critical to track how it is being received by employees and customers and to iterate to improve how it lands with these populations.Leadership Focus & Action: ensuring that the leadership layer of a company has the appropriate bandwidth and prioritization to focus on what matters most, and the time and leverage to galvanize powerful action. Personal note: i’ve seen countless organizations where leadership layers are drowning in their BAU (business as usual) work, and don’t have enough time to focus on the highest-impact areas. This can be deadly to a company over timeExternal Awareness: being attuned to what is happening in the external world outside of a company. Especially in large organizations, it is easy to lose sight of what is happening in the external market. Competitive understanding should not be outsourced to a specific strategy or GTM team; it should be the responsibility of all employees to appreciate the macro environment, competitive movements, etc. If many people in an organization understand this, the feedback you get on your strategy will be more precise and helpful —> which will help your organization learn about how to adjust their approaches.  I challenge you to think about how your company could upgrade in these areas. One thing I’m personally proud of in my work life is our strong Leadership Focus & Action. At basically no time have I ever wondered what outcomes I’m responsible for… And our CEOs have always been hyper supportive of “cutting out the scope that isn’t moving the needle”…which helps us generally protect our time to drive results #OKRsSubscribe1Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#45 - Shorts: A Framework to Improve the Impact/ROI of StrategyCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

No pre-amble this week, here’s the list:They are naturally optimistic, but real about how they feel and what they thinkThey follow-up critical observations with suggested next steps immediatelyThey look “left to right” outside of their core responsibilities to create ways that the entire team/org could be betterThey are patient enough (there is great value in being impatient sometimes)They speak upThey seek feedback proactivelyThey manage up, over, and downThey constantly anchor what they are doing back to the overall objectives they are supporting #PerspectiveThey find ways to mentor and coach others, even when they don’t have direct reportsThey have a bias for action and map out ideas / proposals on paper instead of constantly saying things like, “we should be doing…” without any tangible contribution beyond words (digital or otherwise)They set boundaries around their work hours + they do NOT take calls or check e-mails on vacation. When they disconnect, they disconnect —> sets a positive example for others (recognize this can be hard depending on what you’re working on…I’ve certainly had many vacations and days off disrupted, but do not interrupt my time off if it’s not absolutely mission critical)They manage their air timeThey are responsive + they over-communicate on status updates + roadblocks they’re seeing + how they’re thinking about overcoming roadblocksThey are very clear when they have an askThey think carefully about who else should be involved in a conversationRegardless of level, they are willing to do things like take notes, build slides, schedule calls, etc. They constantly try to be more self-aware of their emotions, how they process, and are vulnerable enough to share where they are, especially during difficult conversationsThey give people the benefit of the doubt instead of assuming negative intentThey look at the outside world / market to find ideas for how we could be doing things better They ask for what they need and want professionallyI could probably write another 80 points for this, but will leave this here for now and just express gratitude to the many wonderful people I have worked with over the years, and especially in the last few.

Gridlock. Traffic. Being stuck standing in line, with no movement. After 30+ years of reflection, I’ve concluded that the lack of movement is one of the things that frustrates me the most, and it doesn’t just happen in traffic: it happens at work. Whenever I’m working in a particularly large organization (read: many layers of approval required to pivot strategy), one of the tactics I’ve fallen in love with is multi-threading. When I use this word, I do not mean “multi-tasking”… Multi-threading is when we fast-track an early MVP (minimum viable product) of something to market to get real feedback, while continuing to work on subsequent product releases that benefit from more internal stakeholder and external customer feedback. Used in a sentence: “Let’s multi-thread this. Target MVP1 launching in 3 weeks to a limited set of customers, while we work through MVP2, MVP3, and Full Launch 1 over the coming 6 months” - Source: brainHere are two parallel realities: one with and one without multi-threadingThe Situation:Imagine you’re sitting in a large management layer meeting with twenty people. You work at a digital health company that provides telehealth care specifically for people struggling with sleep problems. During this meeting, one of your colleagues, Jessica, is presenting on the idea of adding a new product offering around faster on-demand access. One of the things she says is, “Many customers are asking for the ability to quickly access a practitioner to get quick advice on things like bedtime rituals, dietary modifications, and mental exercises for calming your brain down before bedtime.”This is where the stories diverge. What usually happens next?Reality 1 without multi-threading (duration: 30 weeks to customer feedback): Week 1: Jessica gets loads of ideas about how to act on the customer feedbackWeek 1-7: Jessica suggests that the team spend the next 6 weeks learning more about the feedback they’re receiving + develop 2-3 concepts to solve the problem Week 8: Team presents to management group again, and gets yet more feedback. Reminder: they are not presenting to customers; they’re presenting to their own internal teamWeek 8-16: Jessica then says they’ll spend another 2 months building out an MVPWeek 16-18: Then Jessica and team will come back to leadership group with concepts for how to act on feedback, and they — again — get loads of feedback. They go back to drawing board, and they will get another chance to present in two weeksWeek 18-22: They come back and present their concept again, and the group once again provides feedback that will take the team another month to work throughWeek 22-26: This process continues until the original concept has been shaved and formed into something that is almost totally devoid of hutzpahWeek 30: After legal and compliance review, eventually a green light is given for an MVP launch, and the team is congratulated for their impact. After 30 weeks of effort, a customer finally sees the MVP for the first time… And they don’t give a crap, because they found a platform to do what they needed three months agoReality 2 with multi-threading (Duration: 9 weeks. 21 weeks shorter than reality 1, and far more exciting + less painful for the core working team)Week 1: Jessica gets loads of ideas about how to act on the customer feedbackWeek 1 (Friday afternoon): Jessica and a tiger team get together for a 3-hour working session with the goal of having an experience mocked up in Figma, with steps, preliminary views of who on the team will drive the tests, and they end with a list of 10-20 customers who’ve expressed interestWeek 2: The team reaches out to 10 of their customers and asks if they would be interested in giving feedback on “a new experience” that your team is testing. 4 people respond Week 3: You talk to four people and get feedback, and work that feedback into updated mock-upsWeek 4: Development on new feature set, outreach to other 10 customers. Six respond this timeWeek 5: You talk to five customers (one had to reschedule) and they actually click through this new experience and get to test drive it during this “alpha testing” callWeek 6: You come back to management with actual customer feedback, usage insights, and you also share a product roadmap of what the launch in three weeks will look like, and what future releases throughout the next year might entail. You also share metrics you’re targeting with each release, and enlist other leaders to lean into help (Marketing for GTM support, sales for targeted testing in the sales cycle, engineering for ongoing development support, product for ongoing feature refinement and market research)Week 9: MVP does a limited, “early release” to a small subset of customers who have opted in to try the new feature. You get more usage data and feedback. This helps you to inform future releasesWeek 30: You’ve had four separate releases that have iterated based directly on customer feedback, and you've also uncovered an opportunity to partner with another company to help scale the people resourcing required to bring this product to market across your entire 100,000-user customer base                              (Don’t take this way… OR that way… take both ways)SubscribeNotice that the latter reality (above) resulted in a far higher-quality experience for customers and business growth Because the team was nimble, and was given the ability to test with customers, and not just test with internal stakeholders. All work should have a customer validation plan.Customer obsession is not internal-hierarchy obsession.  I’ve found that internal stakeholder obsession leads to sustained mediocrity and a slower pace of innovation.The bigger your company, the easier it is to be far away from customers. Distance to Customer should be minimized for EVERY SINGLE PERSON at a company. Everyone must have chances to either directly interact with customers or at least hear from them regularly. Customers Buy Products. Focus On Customers. What is this not? This means do not just focus on making your boss or senior leaders happy. Yes, they are a stakeholder group. They are important. They should be engaged, but they are not the group you need to obsess about.When you work in a big organization, you should — from the very beginning of an initiative — set the expectation that you want validated customer feedback from customers WHILE continuing to build out more mature versions of your productAnd I think this is really the bottom-line takeaway here. The easiest way to implement multi-threading into your work is to immediately set a dual objective for your projects. Goal 1 should be getting validated feedback as quickly as possible. Goal 2 should be about the longer-term, more “polished” … “refined” vision. Failure to do this will keep people pursuing perfection at the expense of progress. Startups inherently understand this and move far faster than large companies do as a result. While you’re in a smaller organization, do everything you can to protect being nimble and fast. While you’re in a larger organization, talk about multi-threading as a way to harness the spirit of a startup. Because, jeez, the vast majority of senior executives I’ve ever met tend to want to “move like a startup.”Want more of this?

Let’s use dating apps as an example (I’ve had probably five entrepreneurs reach out pitching their dating app startup in the last three months, so this feels like a good, helpful example). How in the hell are you going to break through and gain any customers, let alone scale to the point where your company is known by most/all of your target potential customers? The answer is: you need to be differentiated, and that differentiation must flow through every part of your organization, go-to-market messaging, and customer + product experience. By far my favorite tactic to support powerful differentiation is Counter-Positioning.First, a definition of Counter-Positioning: \"Counter-positioning is finding part of your competitor’s business model that they cannot do without and flipping the script on them. It was popularized in a book called “7 Powers” by Hamilton Helmer. It is especially effective when you are a smaller and/or newer competitor going up against an established giant.                                                                                                           - Source: Leading AgileTranslation: constantly emphasizing how your company and product are different as a means to show consumers that their current experience isn’t the only option. That there is be a better way than whatever is currently known to you…There are about 50 other letters covering topics like this. If you dig my writing, please do consider sharing it with one person :)ShareHere are some examples of counter-positioning that come to mind for me:The Zero Proof (non-alcohol beverages): you don’t have to drink alcohol to have an interesting, non-soda beverage. (Full disclosure: this is an Overline company)Batdorf & Bronson (coffee): your coffee can be better than StarbucksAirtable (databases, forms): building your own tailored processes shouldn’t be so wonky and outdatedPepsi: We’re better and cooler than Coca-Cola. Why drink Coke when you could drink something that most people think tastes better? (subtle implication: what you’re doing now — drinking that drink — could be better)Pepsi’s famous Pepsi challenge would be a decent example here. They were literally investing tens of millions of dollars into a marketing strategy that hinged on them constantly pushing a message of “We are different. We aren’t Coke. We are BETTER. And the people around you tend to agree whenever they try our product.)Kinto Water bottles: plastic water bottles are bad for the environment, and they look cheap. Don’t you want a water bottle that is as stylish as the rest of your image?ChatGPT (via Satya Nadella): Last week during the Bing announcement, Satya Nadella said the following, which was a very clear dig at Google: “We’re going to move fast, and for us, every day we want to bring out new things and most importantly, we want to have a lot of fun innovating again in search, because it’s high time.”Note: “innovation again” in search (because he wants you to think Google hasn’t been)Note: “It’s high time” = it’s about time people! Don’t you want a better search experience? Andreessen Horowitz vs Benchmark and Sequoia (VC): when a16z launched, they were the bold upstart investor, rebelling against the ways of working and even attitude of the establish VCs in the Bay Area. One example of how their counter-positioning showed up in their organization was their original requirement that all investment partners had operating experience (read: they were saying, “the only people who will invest in you have actually operated or founded a startup before. We aren’t just ex-bankers and people who’ve only been in finance…Which was quite common at that time). Credit: Acquired podcast who has an entire episode series dedicated to the rise of a16z and their use of couner-positioningSo basically: counter-positioning is placing your competitor on a pedestal, and then yelling about how your company is different and better (or faster…or cheaper without sacrificing value).How Can My Business Start to Leverage This Strategy? (Let’s takedown Starbucks as an example here)First, you need to do a comprehensive analysis on the competition you’re trying to take marketshare away from. Understanding them deeply is how you’ll, point-by-point, brainstorm how you are differentRemember: market making is creating a new category. Creating a new need and capturing customers who have that need. Market taking is when you are directly poach customers away from another brand. E.g., Pepsi replacing coca-cola in dat fridgeSecond, you need to document their value proposition to the market and create an “objection” or “counter” to each and every point. Example: Starbucks:1. They offer a “third place” from home2. They offer coffee fast3. They offer a consistent set of products4. They are everywhere / easy to access5. They customize your beverages however you want6. They are the most recognizable coffee brand in the worldNewCo Coffee Shop (our new, burgeoning startup coffee “concept” — btw YUCK. Every new restaurant now is a “concept” and it’s becoming the very definition of cliche). Here’s how we will counter-position against the six points above:Counter 1. That third place, Starbucks, doesn’t feel special because it’s everywhere. The designs are all generally the same. There is no feeling of deeper connection to the local communities they’re withinCounter 2. Our coffee is extremely carefully made, and takes longer to make. Your patience will be rewarded with a more enjoyable, special cup of coffeeCounter 3. We are constantly offering new beans and add-ins as a way for you to discover new products in pursuit of that illusive perfect cup, and we connect you to the local (or growing, small) businesses that make these productsCounter 4: We are only located in the trendiest neighborhoods. If you’re going on a roadtrip out of town, you probably will miss us, and we’re OK with that. We look forward to welcoming you back when you’re here!Counter 5: We also customize your beverages, but we do it with far higher-quality ingredients, and are extra thoughtful about ratios of add-ins. If you want a super sweet dessert coffee, we are not the place for you. Go to Starbucks for thatCounter 6:  Those who know, know. We aren’t for everyone, and we’re not trying to be for everyone.For the dating app entrepreneurs I mentioned above, this would mean: understanding the landscape of dating apps, their value propositions, and finding your “special sauce” for how you’re different Example: there was a Techstars company I got to meet called Whirl that is all about friends setting their friends. Some of their early marketing / decks poked at how existing competitors aren’t the most safe or trustworthy platforms, and they’ve stuck in my memory every time I come across a new dating app founder — what’s your edge? How are you different? How are you not just another dating app that has a different UI on what’s fundamentally the same product?)By the way, I met my wife on The League! While the branding makes me cringe whenever I think about it (because it can be very very exclusionary), I honestly wanted a bit of that in dating! The app positioned itself as for people who were highly educated (which isn’t something I particularly cared about), and I knew I wanted to find someone who would encourage my nonstop nerdiness + preoccupation with business strategy, in addition to — first and foremost — just being an amazing human being. The app worked, and their positioning gave me enough hope that I was actually willing to pay $150 for a membership (hey, seem crazy? YOU try dating in the middle of Manhattan!)Moving beyond Starbucks tear-downs and how I met my wife on a dating app: counter-positioning is both direct and boldBusiness is a competition, and the companies that embrace this are the ones that win. Yes, there’s a place for collaboration / joint ventures (see #34 on joint ventures as a business strategy), but there’s also a place for putting the metaphorical boxing gloves on and jabbing at your competitors. Knocking them off their game. Pissing them off, and getting them distracted……All while you focus on executing well with your customers, and slowly creating ambassadors who will tell their friends, “wait, you’re still using X product?? Dude, you need to try this new thing.”I’ll end on a final example: this newsletter! Although this isn’t a business (you didn’t have to pay anything to be reading this :-)), it is something I take seriously enough to do every week, and I am targeting a certain level of impact on you. I want for you to find value here that you can’t / haven’t found somewhere else. In my case, I’m counter-positioning against Forbes, Inc. Magazine, Fast Company, and even — to some extent — publications like HBR…These publications sometimes release wonderful content, but increasingly they put out super shallow, not-very-specific content that isn’t engineered for people who are trying to be the best in the world at management. They cater to the every-day reader of business stuff, but probably not to You. I’ll admit that I’ve seen some wonderful content on “how to thrive in a remote work environment” and “how to make sure your work environment is inclusive”, but deeper, nuanced business strategy? Only HBR does that of the above companies I gave you. If the others did, then Substack wouldn’t exist, and there wouldn’t be thousands of other people doing what I’m doing: offering a deeper level of specificity and personality in their writing.

Take care to remember that delegating something to someone else doesn’t mean disconnecting or forgetting about it. After the article, there is a list of other letters I’ve debated writing recently. Would love your feedback on any topics you’d like to see covered!“Feedback is a gift” is a statement I love, but I think too many people assume feedback has to come from others. You can give yourself the gift of feedback at any time. A couple of months ago, as I did a review of everything on my plate at work, I realized that I had been delegating some things and not staying connected enough. I knew there was a problem the moment I couldn’t tell a concise, nuanced story about how two projects had evolved over time. How did this happen? Simply by following the advice of this methodology — OKRs — and business school of thought that espouses Radical Focus (one of my favorite books btw). Here’s exactly what has happened over time: First off, I think autonomy is addicting for high-performing peopleI try to always hire/onboard/recruit high performers. These people are growing quickly in their careers and need less and less oversight over timeWhen working in teams of high performing people, you will invariably give responsibility to these people who, over time, develop a track record of getting things doneIn letter #35 “So you want to get promoted” there’s a whole section on how trends, not dots are what allow people to take on more scope at work. Taking on more work and executing well is how people prove themselvesAs people prove themselves, it’s easy to continue to hand them work, knowing that it’ll be done well. Yay!Over time, you can take for granted that “they have it covered”, and use that freed-up bandwidth to go focus radically on other thingsI started leaning in super heavily to two key initiatives at my company, and getting high-level updates from my team members once per weekLet’s pause here. This… This is the type of moment where the problems of disconnection can begin. It is at this point where you hit a tipping point in confidence that you might think: “Hey, team has this.” This is dangerous.SubscribeWhat happens when we mistake delegation for disconnectionThings go wrong, and when they do you need to scramble to get caught up to speed. This does not feel goodYour lack of presence undermines your ability to provide quality feedbackQuality does NOT mean overly-general statements. It means specific observations followed by specific suggestions built upon a deep understand of a situation and a person’s role in said situationYou may focus so much on one bucket of threads that you no longer have the time to check in on the ones you’ve delegatedYou can begin to under-appreciate the evolutions in the machine you’re operating within, because each project you’re involved in is giving you signals — information — as to what has happened, is happening, and might happen soonYour colleagues can feel isolated, and like they aren’t getting the support they needYou might not feel as connected to your work…because you literally are not as connected to what is happeningThis can feel awful. Don’t get me wrong: work comes third for me — My family and friends come first and second, respectfully (although “friend family” is a common term uttered in this house)… But we spend far too much time at work for it to not be enjoyable. It was either Plato or Aristotle (hazy at the moment) who said something along the lines of, it’s not enough to live life. One must live life well. ….Welllll, work is a part of life, and we spend a lot of time doing it. I’d like to feel energized by it, ideally. That is far easier when you’re leaned into the work, and pursuing excellence in what you do for no other reason beyond excellence itself (see this Psychology Today write-up on this topic)(insert the many other points you might have by clicking the button below)Leave a comment(Real image of what it’s like to work in any organization. Even if you’re at a 2-person startup, the only way to grow is to connect to the ecosystem around you. If you’re at one of the largest companies on earth (**COUGHS LOUDLY**) then this is a reflection of what tracking the machine can feel like… And though it’s impossible to track everything, you can — and should — strive to understand the “happenins”… the news in your part of the world)I am not suggesting that one should not delegate, but rather that you should do it thoughtfully and plan to stay “close” where you canAt a bare minimum, I think anyone who is delegating something should be aware of how it’s progressing on a very regular basis and should take the time to go deeper into the nuances on a semi-regular basis. Let me be more specific with an example: Let’s say you are managing 10 projects (this is usually the load of projects I’m simultaneously balancing). They cover things like: Net new customer experience designFeedback dynamics around existing customer experienceSales motion executionProduct positioning adjustmentsMedium-to-long range strategy developmentCapability assessmentNew feature X designNew feature Y designSomething relating to culture of our organizationSomething relating to data management Something related to a vendor / consulting firmSomething related to a new marketing platform we’re standing upEtc. etc., yada yada: you get the pointWhat should one do? For each of these projects, there should: be a weekly or bi-weekly check-in at a bare minimumSome regular point where you get a longer period of time to get into the weeds of a projectWeekly or bi-weekly time with the key or multiple key stakeholders from each project (gotta be reasonable here…lest your calendar get absolutely out of control. I think many of us have been there, and/or may be there)Monthly steering check-ins that have a more collaborative tenor to them, because it totally sucks when you spend two weeks preparing for a meeting instead of 8-9 days actually making progress, and then one day creating the story and materials to communicate it all + tee up questions to leverage the brains of your steering committeeReminder for later: need to write about how to run kickass board meetings. I’ve been fortunate enough to spend a decent amount of time in them, although I am definitely still learning a lot here!And at all times, you should know how all of these efforts fit together, and what result(s) they are driving. Which leads me to the final point: you are responsible for understanding what is happening around you, and driving the connections between various parties/actors around you to make shit happen! Do you need to follow the above playbook? Absolutely not. But if you find yourself unable to concisely tell the story of work you are accountable for… Unable to share experiences from the team… Unable to accurately recite the next steps…and Unable to consistently find ways to add real value to said projects, then you have a problem… And the best place to start in solving this problem? To connect to the problem. To immerse yourself within it. To understand it. It’s from this base of deeper, nuanced (god, I love the word “nuance”) understanding that you can start to be a force multiplier for the people around you.MDIf you liked this, please consider sharing this post and/or the ~50 other letters available at Exonomist.Substack.comSharePersonal notes: I almost wrote about a couple of other topics this week.

If you’re reading this and you think it would be helpful for me to write about slightly more personal topics related to the psychology or emotions we feel as humans, please do let me know. The letters I was thinking about / starting to write included: “What to do when you are stuck in a funk”“Dealing with Setbacks”“How to Be Aggressive (Enough) at Work”“Moments that have me say Wow during startup pitches”“Wherever you go, there you are — viewing situations objectively to find nuggets of wisdom”“The dangers of prioritizing ownership over outcomes (#politics)”“What I’m Reading (and learning) Right Now”“Finding joy in the pursuit of micro-level greatness (greatness in your every day tasks)Finally, I’m re-sharing another letter — “The Super Stretch Assignment (short form)” — because it continues to resonate with me, and I have really enjoyed creating opportunities for people to super stretch recently!Exonomist by Michael DavisLetter 019 - The Super Stretch Assignment (Short Form)I was recently reflecting on how thankful I am for my teams (the ones I currently manage, and the ones I have managed in the past).

Were you expecting a marketing campaign? For this to turn into a business? For me to start having a premium, paid subscriber business? I wasn’t!This whole thing has been a wonderful experiment that is evolving in real-time, which is to say: I didn’t even know what it would turn out to be 14 months ago when I started cranking out letters. I didn’t envision writing about family — my focus area is on the art of management, which includes “self management.”But when I reflect on where this whole interest came from, it came from my Dad. It came from watching him do this thing called “business-building” and “deal making” while we were a purely-middle class family in the outskirts of Atlanta, dreaming that maybe — just maybe — the future could be a little bit brighter. As I watched him work 80+ hours every week for years, I marveled at how a human being could possibly stay sane, let alone passionate about something that was so utterly brutal. I also observed the crushing downsides of huge responsibility, and have been endlessly fascinated by how one can configure themselves and their behavior in such a way as to help them make a notable, positive impact on the world… all while living “a good life” (meaning that you haven’t wrecked your mental or physical health, and that you feel emotionally fulfilled…or something like that).All of that came from generations and generations of people before us, people like my grandmother. Joan Davis passed away earlier today, March 14th, 2023. She passed surrounded by family, likely hearing the sounds of young children laughing while the cool Georgia sun streaked into her room. She passed after 89 years with us, and having gifted the world a wonderful book of poems, many inappropriate sex jokes, and three wonderful children who are each warm, kind, and unbelievably intelligent. She came from nothing (financially) and something (spiritually as it relates to family), raised three successful children out of the hoods of Washington, D.C., and lived out her later years seeing five grandchildren do awesome things that I doubt her late husband, Eugene, could have ever imagined possible. But beyond her broader impact, she was just a wonderful human who constitutes some of my earliest memories of life. Her cooking was BOMB, and her pride in her grandchildren was out of this world. She was never shy at telling us how proud she was of us all, and she was always there to give you advice and to remind you to work harder than you think you needed to, but also to know when to give yourself a break.(This is me and my grandmother on a dream vacation to Hawaii when I was 16. It was our first “big” vacation… The longest flight I had taken at that point in my life. My grandfather had passed a bit before this, and my mom, Dad, grandma, and I went to the islands for a week. I was a moody god damned teenager, dealing with a breakup on the trip, but/and my grandmother and I talked for many hours about life, dreams, and everything in between).I oftentimes will use the word “incredible” to describe where the family has come under her stewardship. Let’s break down that word I just quoted — in - credible. Reasonably understood to mean, not credible. Reasonably assumed to mean: so wild as to not be credible. I stand by the usage of this word because what she produced was just that — so wild as to seem like bullshit. Raise three Black kids in one of the roughest zip codes in the United States, with zero family “wealth”, an extremely low chance of success for each of them. And yet, all three somehow had excellent grades in high school, made it into literally some of the best institutions in the world, somehow came out to be wonderful humans who are kind and giving, self-critical and deeply interested in learning more about others. They care about the world right around them, and the world far beyond them… And they welcome people into their homes so often that, at this point, it’s sometimes hard to remember who is actually a blood relative and who isn’t. Oh, and bonus points for having an IMMENSE propensity for service, philanthropy, and civics. So, how did she do it? Eleven lessons from my grandmotherThis is a question I’ve been trying to answer for years, especially as we plan for a future with kids running around (well, my dog child is currently running around, barking at — can you BELIEVE it?? — dogs outside of our home). I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to answer it fully, but I’ll try to do it now if for no reason beyond paying homage to a wonderful human being, and letting her know, explicitly, some of the things I take away from the countless hours we spent together over the last 32 years. At this point, not sure if I’m going to elaborate on them… We’ll see what I feel like saying/doing as I go through this.Have a high standard for yourself (in how you behave, in what you will achieve personally and professionally)Be polite to others, even when they are impolite to youWhen it comes to learning, work harder than you think you need to…But also have fun on a regular basisKeep rituals (daily, monthly, yearly)Freaking just be kind to other peopleDon’t interrupt other people; listen more before you respond (…I think I’m like 90% good about this)Practice gratitude for every thing you have. Taking things for granted is the beginning of spiritual declineSpend time writing (I’ll link Invest the time in understanding your family’s history — the great, the good, the neutral / confusing, the bad, and the uglyDiscipline wins championships (a.k.a.: trends not dots)Show your gratitude; don’t assume that others knowInvest deeply in your family. Keep in touch with them. Check in on them. Invite them over regularly, and actually take the time to ask them about their lives!And your “family” doesn’t just need to be blood relatives. It can be people who come to be so central to your life that they transcend into being what I like to call “friend fam”And i’ll leave it there for now. I like to think these points are some of the underpinnings of how I try to show up for friends, family, and colleagues every day… And while I surely have plenty of things I’m workin’ on (don’t we all?), I think it’s healthy to reflect on the things we’ve done right and done well. And when I think back to how any of the positive things I’ve done were possible, it starts with the foundation I internalized from my family, and my grandmother was a massive part of that. …But one more thing (I just heard Steve Jobs say that, and feel like I’m setting you up for disappointment because I’m not revealing the next iPhone): your life is a precious, special thing. And the time you have on this Earth is nothing short of a gift. To the best of your ability, remember to slow time down every so often and just relish the people and things you have around you. As I reflect on a woman passing after 89 years alive, I’m reminded of the fact that every day is fleeting, and that time is your most valuable resource… And how you spend your time matters, even the brief — seemingly typical — moments with your friends and families.I’ll be back next week with a more typical Exonomist letter. I’ve really been wanting to share some of what’s been circling in my head about this book I want to write on ancient Empires, management lessons from said empires, and how that can relate to the organization of our markets today. I’ve been going back and forth between writing a really purely career-focused book and doing something that’s more purely business focused… But what I keep coming back to is both of those topics, and also my enduring love of the Classics and ancient civilizations. Probably a 20% chance the book project ends up actually being set in this intersection of Business, Career, and Empires…But hey: you gotta give it a go and see if it works!1Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#50 - Lessons from Joan Davis (RIP, 3/14/23)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMore1Share",

I call it the Three Layers of OffenseMichael DavisMar 28, 2023Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#51 - Should you kill your to do list?Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareThis letter is more of a true public journaling. It’s written more as a review of how I’m approaching task management these days, while re-appreciating tactics that have worked.I took last week off of work to reset a bit, do some writing, and enjoy the wonders of being at home (#staycation). I envisioned an ultra relaxing week, where I would spend most of my days writing, reading, taking long walks in the park. This is not what happened. What actually happened was a list of To Do’s came up, and I ended up spending (probably) most of last week just working through life chores. This has come at a time when I’m generally re-evaluating how to balance rest with productivity when the work schedule keeps me busy. To help in this evaluation, I spent a bit of time re-reading up on how very “busy” people manage their schedules. Some of the busiest people I’ve ever met are startup founders. They’re all balancing personal lives with a weekly schedule that can easily range from 70 to 110 hours (check out this great article on startup founder time management from the CEO of Levels published via first round capital). This is where I spent some time trying to learn. One of the most powerful takeaways from this article was the idea of killing your to do list. Wait, what? The idea here is that you should be using your calendar as your To Do list, something I’ve done on and off over the years. How can you actually make this work? I’ve personally found it difficult to fully adopt this system, BUT what has worked is allocating a consistent portion of each day to general task management. This is my whole idea of GSD, GNT, GTD — get shit done, get nothing done, get thinking done. One of the biggest mistakes a person can make is to be in meetings all day, every day. Trust me: I’ve been here a lot, and this is almost never the state when my best work is being done. The implication for Managers is to structure work in a way that deliberately gives extra space or “slack”We’ve historically tried to model out 70% of a person’s time actually be on their core responsibilities, with the remaining 30% being for things like time away, admin, compliance, learning, and other special projects If you’re in an organization and role where you have some control over your schedule, you can take advantage of this whole “calendar as your to do list” way of thinking But what if you work in a job where you have zero calendar control?Then you should probably keep a To Do list. But not just any ol’ list… You should keep a prioritized list, so that you know what to get to first when that inevitable free space opens up. My approach — Just like companies, your own personal management system probably needs to change over time…I have the Three Layers of Offense I’ve changed my own task management approach probably once every six months for the last 15 years. Some specific tactics have earned their way to surviving each of these changes. They include: Rebuilding your To Do list on a regular basisFinding great joy in removing things from the list (…which can mean NOT doing a thing)Always keeping a “backlog” of things you’ll do at some point Having separate categories for Personal Life and Work Life, and always filling out and looking at the Personal Life category firstHere’s a screenshot of what my Notion categories look like The most critical items across these lists get pulled over to my calendar to make sure I’m building in space to get them done. And if they don’t get done, then they get moved into another day on the calendar. This sort of triple redundancy is how I personally stay on top of all the different threads of lifeLayer 1 = identifying the need and internalizing it in my brainLayer 2 = writing it down on my to do listLayer 3 = calendar-ing the most critical and time-sensitive thingsThese three layers of offense can take a bit more time to setup, but I’ve found it to be effectiveThank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. There are 50+ letters like this one available for free at exonomist.substack.comShareTactically, I don’t recommend having multiple calendars or multiple lists. Strive to have things in one or two places max. My setup is: Notion for To Do lists and general Life Operating SystemOutlook for calendar And if I do schedule something from another calendar, I add it to my Outlook/work. Yes, this means that my “work” calendar also has personal stuff on it. I use the “personal” marker to preserve some privacy, but I know that by doing this I am giving up some degree of data privacy. This is something I’m comfortable with, as the stress of checking multiple calendars just did not work for me. Maybe it’ll work for you.So, should you do it?My personal answer is No, killing the To Do list in its classical, list-based form is probably not the move for most people. I think if you work in a job with a moderate-to-high degree of uncertainty day-to-day, it can be super challenging to make this work. I have seen CXOs who have admins make it work as well as some very super organized people, but for most of us mere mortals it’s just probably not totally reasonable. However, I do think it’s wise to take inspiration from this idea, as it can help you make sure you’re allocating time to tackle the things that are most important. For example, I have a 2.5-hour block later this week to just think through and write about my org’s corporate strategy. That is a super duper important exercise that, if done well, can materially impact the trajectory of our business. But I’m not calendar-ing everything I have to do. If you want to use your calendar as a productivity tool, you actually do have to adhere to it. What value is putting something on the calendar if you’re never going to do it? I think it’s important to be realistic about this, lest your calendar artificially starts to look like a Tetris board and will stress you out even more. I re-learned that lesson recently when an Life item (…part of our taxes) sat as a recurring reminder for two months before it got touched. Which leads us to the end, and back to this idea the sparked this letter — balancing rest with productivity. There’s no universally golden ratio for everyone, but I’ve generally found that it’s a healthy and productive thing to prioritize recovery…But that as your life complexities grow, you have to really work at carving time for rest and relaxation. I’ve found the mix of To Do List, Calendar, and strict rules around hours worked and keeping at least ONE weekend day totally open for fun+relaxation to be helpful.

Plus: a peek into a slightly neurotic way to track personal goalsMichael DavisApr 05, 2023Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#52 - The Balance of Committed versus Aspirational Goals (OKRs)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareAs much as you’d expect me to be totally sick of OKRs given that I work in the space, at a company that operates what I think is the best goal-management platform on the market, I still love the methodology. It’s so simple…so powerful, and yet putting it into practice is equal parts art and science. It’s primarily meant for business, but it can be equally useful for your personal goal setting!For those of you who don’t know what OKRs are, here’s my quick, things-you-must-know primer….A Super Fast Primer on OKRsThe Objective and Key Results (OKRs) = a goal-setting and strategy execution systemObjectives can be thought of as being “Goals” and Key Results as “metrics” — “What do I want to accomplish?” (Objective) and “How will I know I’ve been successful?” (Metric)The greatest risk to OKR health is this thing known as setting it and forgetting it. It’s that most familiar phenomenon whereby you set goals in, say, January, and then only check in on them a few times on your way to December.The power of OKRs is that you are focusing your entire organization on a small (3-5) set of goals, adjusting those goals based on validated learning on a regular basis —> harnessing the power of reflection and the clarity provided by metrics to pivot, pivot, pivot until you’ve achieved your objectivesThe superpower of OKRs is that you’re setting stretch goals that force you to embrace discomfort as you try to achieve milestones that might not be easy to achieveIf you want to read more about OKRs, I recommend reading: High-Output Management, OKRs For All (written by our CEO), and checking out this page (scroll about half-way down for a bunch of resources). But despite the recommendation to set stretch goals, should all of your goals be stretch goals? Easy answer. No. … …Why? Because if all of your goals are stretch goals, you’ll probably burn out. Additionally, if you fail to achieve your goals, your team can feel demoralized at the end of the quarter / review period (some organizations review every quarter…some every six months. I recommend quarterly). I like to think of the mix of goals like this: You should be focusing on no more than 3-5 goals. Beyond that, your time is spread too thinlyWithin these goals, let’s say there are five, you should balance out your goals between Aspirational and Committed. What’s the difference between Aspirational and Committed goals, and what’s the ideal ratio to adopt? Aspirational Goals = stretch goals. Goals that make you slightly uncomfortable / scared when you think about achieving them. If you achieve 70% of your goal, that’s probably GREATPersonal Example: “Achieve proficiency in French in 2023” — this is hard one for me. It’s on my goal list, but it’s definitely a stretch. Committed Goals = What I like to call “non-negotiable” goals. These are goals you have to achieve fullyPersonal Example: “Eat vegetables with 2 meals every day” — this is something I have to achieve. It’s non-negotiable for me, and it is totally feasible that I can achieve this for the vast majority of meals over a yearIn my humble opinion, I think every organization & person should have a mix of both categories of goalsAcross the many organizations I’ve worked with on their OKR approach, most land on doing about 50%/50% when it comes to the balancing of Aspirational vs. CommittedThink about this 50/50 balance in your life? You simply cannot set stretch goals everywhere without increasing the risk of burnout, and the risk of burnout is the kind of thing that can completely, utterly undermine the achievement and maintenance of a happy and healthy lifeThink someone else would dig this? Consider sharing Exonomist! There are 50+ more letters around topics like this, business strategy, startups, and self-managementShareSo, what should I do with this now? Potential ActionsEveryone sets goals. We aren’t all as disciplined in keeping them top of mind, checking in on them regularly, and adjusting them. If you’re getting to this point and wondering, “Well, Michael, what exactly should I do with this?”Some Options for You:Do absolutely nothing. Continue on with your life (hey, totally viable option)Take the step of actually writing out 3-5 goals you have on paperIf you’re really serious about it, consider putting your goals into a tool like Notion or Excel and attaching some metrics to help you more effectively check-inMetrics…numbers are a pathway to truth Bonus points: you schedule time with yourself to actually check in on your goals!I do this at least once per month. Go get space by yourself, put some music on, and literally go category by category. I try to spend 5-10 minutes on each, and I use journaling / writing as a way to force me to get deep on each goalBonus bonus points if you realize that you have goals that aren’t feasible, and you remove them from your list. Better to focus on three things you actually can accomplish than to lie to yourself about your ability to achieve five, as an exampleIn closing, an acknowledgement of over-engineeringIt’s so easy to over-engineer goals. I’ve had years where I’ve literally set metrics for every category of goals, put a matrix together and then tracked my progress every day. I’m not kidding: here’s a screenshot(categories = lite breakfast, eating greens, stretching, reviewing my daily operating model for work, lite or big workout, calling family, doing one fun thing within reading, making music, or playing a game, working on another language, reviewing my schedule for the next day)While I’ve found this degree of tracking to be helpful at certain points in my life where I’m dialing up (trying to seriously upgrade my performance in life across some specific dimension or set of dimensions)…But it can also just be super stressful, especially when you get into periods where life throws you curveballs and you can’t make any progress. For some people, you probably can say “screw it” to setting 3-5 very specific, written goals, and simply checking in with yourself on a regular basis to see how you’re doing, and to simply ask the question, “Am I doing what I want in and with my life? What’s gone well lately? What would I like to be different?”Some pressure is healthy, but there’s a thin line between “holding yourself accountable” and “feeling stressed out & disrupted by your goals”MDThanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

Maybe it’s because making it to that very point where you’re on the team is an accomplishment. Like getting picked for a sports team. O the Euphoria!Eh, maybe that’s part of it — like 30%. At least for me, 70% of what makes those moments so resonant is imposter syndrome. It’s that feeling where you feel insecure because you haven’t done this exact thing before. You don’t know if you’re respected by your colleagues. You don’t know how this endeavor is going to turn out, and you’re altogether a ball of nerves.I’ve been there many, many, many times, and those nerves are what lead to increased focus on getting it right. I love that place. That place where you’re trying to \"get it right.” Where you’re unlocking every part of your brain to make something work, and you know that through that exercise you’ll build intellectual muscles. That’s… really cool. ^^^This is how I’ve come to moderate the negative feelings of imposter syndrome, and to almost embrace that feeling because I know what it will lead to… Growth. Most of us (if not all of us) have been here before. The research certainly indicates as much:Up to 82% of people face feelings of impostor phenomenon, struggling with the sense they haven’t earned what they’ve achieved and are a fraud (Bravata, D. M., et al., Journal of General Internal Medicine, Vol. 35, No. 4, 2020).But it’s what you do with the feeling of imposter syndrome that defines how you will grow (or not) and who you are going to beIt’s oh so easy to let those feelings of imposter-ness pulverize any potential of movement… to freeze, to second-guess. To blame others for your feelings. It can stem from this fear of failure. I think the fear of failure is an utterly normal and healthy thing. It’s what makes us think through why a project might fail, something I’ve written about before in Letter 008 - Tactics for Running Kickass Projects is “running a failure prediction exercise.” But what I didn’t cover there was the personal failure prediction exercise. Not just focusing on why a project might fail, but getting underneath how YOU might underperform before it happens. This sort of self-honesty is so hard, but it also can prepare you for what setbacks might be coming…And that pre-processing time investment might just be the narrow difference between freezing up and instead taking action —> learning —> growing.So, to summarize: imposter syndrome is totally normal —> it might cause you to focus in on how to avoid failure —> this dialed-up focus might push you to stretch…to try new things —> and even if you do underperform, you will have learnedTo quote the great Michael Jordan, “I’ve failed over and over again in my life. And that’s why I succeed” == this is the encapsulation of how I’ve thought about imposter syndrome. Always viewing each experience as an attempt… And knowing that, eventually, I’ll get it right. ShareA personal anecdote: in ~March of 2015, I was removed from a project after: (1) clashing with a teammate who I found to be extremely rude, and (2) making a mistake on a model that caused the team to work past our usual 8pm stop time until about 1 in the morning. It felt awful. I remember going into my next project feeling completely, utterly defeated. Here’s what I wrote to myself in my journals during that time :I am completely dejected and incapable of functioning here. Everyone seems smarter and more confident than I am. They’re more polished. They’re all from higher-ranked schools. Their clothes are nicer and more fitted than mine, and they all know that my last project ended with me getting kicked off. They look at me like I don’t belong here, and yet I keep showing up here. Why am I doing this to myself? This fucking hurts. But I keep showing up. And that’s it: keep showing up. Keep trying. One day you will look back on this and marvel at how much you’ve grown. You’ve gotta believe that’s going to happen, even if you don’t have the ability to see the path to that point yet.Oh, and Michael: you really do need to stop procrastinating on asking for coaching and feedback. Even if you feel like these people are a bit hostile towards you, take the leap and ask for coaching. Eventually one of them will say Yes… I hope?Several of them said Yes. They re-taught me everything — how to prepare an agenda, how to take better notes, how to do better storyboarding, how to build cleaner, easier models, how to lean into my technology fluency, how to run kickass meetings, how to ask for and give feedback, how to run incredible customer interviews, etc. — all things that ended up being the foundation of!…. A successful project. And another successful project…And another… and so on. In closing, I still feel imposter syndrome. It’s not as potent as it used to be, but it’s there. I’m constantly around people who have more experience or more depth in areas that I don’t. The pace of change is always so rapid, and we’re all trying to wrap our heads around it and act quickly…and effectively. And the prospect of failure is always right there at our backs. And in those moments of pressure, I take pride in being in the room…In being on the team, because even if you don’t feel like you deserve to be in that room, you probably did deserve your place there. …But keeping your place is an altogether different endeavor that requires you to not lose sight of what you got you here, and to be eyes-wide-open about what will be required of you and those around you to get you there (to your goal). Will write about that at another time, but if you want a bit of a preview just go read my recent letter on Delegation Not Being an Excuse for Disconnection.SubscribeShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#53 - Imposter Syndrome is Totally Normal and Maybe Even Helpful Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

I’m sure it differs by person, but I have the unfair habit of judging new products within the first 10-15 seconds. The very moment I get to a landing page, I’m scrutinizing things like: Design: color system, relative font sizing for big statements versus details, the feeling of dynamism)Marks of trust: (testimonials, badges of approval for security and compliance)Clarity of message: is it extremely obvious what problem this product is solving or is it vague? Here’s a super annoying example: “Enabling your business to operate with greater efficiency” Jesus tapdancing christ, this could not be more vague and empty! Here’s a baller example (full disclosure: Punchlist is an Overline company)What’s working about Punchlist’s landing page? Clearly calling out what the product does, including a short description of how exactly you could use the product. Very easy access to “features” “integrations” “pricing” and “case studies”, and a very clear CTA / sampling opportunity via the Launch field. (Good job, Pete and Bernardo!)I was thinking about this recently in a very different context than high-tech companies: neighborhood pizzerias. There is a pizza shop that opened near me recently, and they are a case study in how to not launch a business and orient customers to the product. Let me tell you what they did, and the opportunities they missed: No web presence (what!) [they should have a website, even a very simple one-pager]Minimal marketing effort whatsoever beyond very low-height signs that could barely be read by passersby [they should’ve landed with a lightning strike in our local market, getting into local magazines, leveraging social, huge signs, etc.]Mediocre product launched in a place with incredible pizza that is priced at the same level as their own [they are literally across the street from a local pizza empire with an amazing product, and about three miles away from one of the very best pizza spots in the entire Atlanta area]Almost no attention paid to design: the interior is drab, the furniture is cheap. It’s obvious one person did this without any sense of humility in asking for help [no suggestion here]Zero effort paid to welcome new customers — instead of being accommodating…offering samples… playing music… smiling / being generally friendly, the experience was the complete opposite: SilentUnfriendly serviceInflexible in accommodating customersSlow The saddest part of all this is that someone took a massive capital risk to launch this store. I don’t know the backstory of the business owners, but I have pretty unique insight into what it’s like to launch small, local businesses and I know that it usually comes from people taking immense personal risk (read: using their 401ks / savings) to get started. Assuming that is the case, this person launched a business that — by all accounts — will be lucky to survive for another six months (we’ve never seen more than 2 people in there, their reviews are wholly mediocre).If only they had spent time thinking thoughtfully about how they would orient users to their product, they may have uncovered some of the above points without having to first burn tens of thousands of dollars and, most importantly, time before hitting an inflection point with customers. …An inflection point that may never come based on the above. Yes, there’s something to be said for testing + learning and MVPs, but at the very very least your product needs to be: (1) easy to understand (checkmark on the above; pizza is easy to understand — LOVE pizza), (2) joyful, (3) supported by friendly…warm service, and (4) marketed to customers in a way that generates curiosity —> interest —> intent to try a product —> hopefully positive feedback that —> gets customers coming back over and over.

(probably not as much as you think)Copy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareHere is a link to Exonomist #1 if you weren’t a subscriber back then when I started this thing. It’s a good pre-read before this essay, as you’ll get reminded about what makes Exonomist — raw, quick, minimally or just not edited.“The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.”                                                                                      - Voltairetl;dr — be a “learn-it-all” not a “know-it-all”Voltaire is alleged to have made this statement. But he’s not the only one who has uttered this idea. Aristotle, Einstein, Hawking all uttered, essentially, the same idea at one point or another. I won’t go so far as to say we don’t know anything, but I think there’s wisdom in embracing the notion of our lack of deep knowledge about many things.I’ve been pondering this idea for the last few weeks. It’s easy to read the title of this essay as a negative thing (please imagine my voice reading it out loud in a suspicious, dark tone), but I mean it to be an overwhelmingly positive thing. Bear with me, I’ll get to why. These are free-write essay, so the journey might not be neat :). Let’s see.It’s the very reality of not knowing something that might lead you to try to find the answer. And, in a way, we’re all trying to find an answer to some set of questions. Questions like: How can I get into better shape? How can I be a better parent? How can I achieve financial comfort?Or on a more business-oriented level, questions like: How do I land more customers? How can we retain our people?How can I gain support for this new product that I think we should build?How is XYZ function doing? There’s always someone out there who is trying to sell you the way to Knowing something, and the stone-cold truth is that most people have little-to-no business giving advice. But this means that some people do have the …trust / brand-permission / experience / track-record / etc. to help you Know more about a topicThe counters to this are legion (hyperbole here). My Dad used to say something similar to me whenever he would comment on people (non-founders) giving him advice on his business. I would always remind him that, “Some of the best ideas come from people who know nothing about your business, and may have very different life experiences.” We would then debate in a rather focused manner for an hour on this exact topic, and I would try to prove that one shouldn’t close their ears to perspective. But my Dad wasn’t totally wrong here, and I wasn’t totally right. So where does this take us, then? I think the implication of all this is:There is so much information around us, to help inform decisions. But not all pieces of information should be weighted equally, and where, who, and when it comes from are deeply relevant factors You should always seek to enhance / validate your POV with a variety of datapoints, to be as informed as possible around a decisionYes, there are times when you need to just “go with your gut” …which may mean going against the grain of what everyone around you is consulting you to do or not doWhen it comes to business, you should always assume there is something you do not know or something you have under-appreciated. You should also assume that your competitors have figured out things you haven’t, at all times.Because what do you really know? Do you know that your marketing organization is doing well? How do you know that? Oh, because the CMO showed you their OKRs and it’s mostly green and you’ve gotten good feedback? OK, all great things, but is that knowing? I don’t think so. I think that’s having evidence to suspect something. Through the reporting out of your results, you can help people to suspect or believe that something is going a certain way, but the only way to know is to have extreme depth across dimensions. For example (and to continue building upon the marketing example):How are the Marketing org’s people doing? (by layer)How are the vendor relationships? How are the key results / key metrics looking? How do the people closest to this capability really feel about its prospects going forward?Are the people here getting what they need? What existential threats exist to this team’s progress? OK, take all of this, and now go imagine you had a panel of 10 of the world’s very best marketing leaders (with expertise at each major stage of the growth journey), and pretend they got to hear the answers to each of these questions. I am fairly certain you would get at least 2 diverging opinions, and in those opinions might be nuggets of wisdom that you should get curious about → → →  unlocking an insight or datapoint you may not have previously discovered.I think this process whereby you accept that you don’t really know as much as you think you do is a beautiful thing. And I think it’s even more powerful for organizations who have mountainous layers of orthodoxy and structure to have people who can just deep dive through those layers to get closer to knowing. To develop stronger ideas about what might be the thing to make the company work better for its employees, customers, and backers (investors / shareholders).Eh, I disagree with myself here actually. I think this is probably just as, if not more, important for startups… Startups who are fighting that most brutal battle for product-market fit, where the competition isn’t just your competitors, it’s the runway you have, the timing of their offerings in the market, and the not-yet-knowing if this thing is going to work… And also knowing without a shadow of a doubt that it’s you who will probably the largest determinant of that. You and your team. As a startup, you are pushing so hard to uncover hidden and not-so-hidden truths about markets, people, technology, regulation… all at once! In closing, and in a huge nod to my employer Microsoft: “Be a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all” ^^^Damn, that might’ve been a better, more concise way to communicate this essay, but — once again — Exonomist is written in a quick-write, no editing format, with typos, and occasionally raw ideas that I will come back to later and disagree with :).

I always admired her lens on life, and she’s a wonderful human being outside of the fact that she is also a total boss on the professional front. I’ve long been trying to find ways that we might work together again… There is still time!Anyways there’s context around this advice (below) that I’ll add in a bit, but the advice was simple, enduring, and powerful: Make Strong Choices. ContextI was approaching the end of a really amazing professional experience and was completely torn up over which next role/job to take. Each role was fundamentally different and would unlock slightly different pathways. The cultures were different. The office locations were different. The types of problems they worked on were for the most part different. And, at that time, much of my identity was wrapped up in my career / title / group, so picking one was akin to choosing a life path. The odd part about this situation was that I had 4-6 months of lead time to make a decision. That is, I knew in January that I’d need to make a decision in May/June, which == a lot of processing time! For another soul this would’ve been delightful. For me, the time was welcomed, but it was too much time, and it ended up leading into something I’ve experienced no less than 15 times in my life: obsessive processing over a decision. I ended up hitting the point of diminishing returns very quickly. Four pages of writing / processing, turned into hours awake at night, which turned into random thinking during the day, which turned into asking close friends for their perspectives (this was super healthy actually) —> which gave me more thoughts to process in the middle of the night. After three months, I had made my decision… three times. “I’m going to do job A!” … then two weeks later, “i’m going to do job B!” etc. etc. Invariably I became intellectually exhausted by the exercise and resigned myself to this processing stage i’ll call: who freaking knows what’s going to happen?Fun stuff: this is the view from my old office. It was pretty insane to see this every day, and it was an incredible place to be in from a career POV, but you always knew that what happened after that situation was up to you to make work.Enter the wisdom of BrittnyAt the point of being wholly burned out by this decision, I confided in my manager at the time. I can’t remember if it was during a walk, or over lunch, or over coffee, or just on a quick phone catch up, but I will never forget her telling me that, “Michael, you know, you can’t go wrong here. Both of these are really sweet options. Sometimes in life you just to make strong choices and just commit 100% to your choice and don’t look back.” … Don’t question what you’ve decided to do, because it IS the choice. This single piece of advice has made so many other aspects of life and work better.How to apply this notion of Making Stronger ChoicesWhen applied to your life, I think this is best applied after you have done some degree of processing whereby you can reasonably say, “I’ve covered almost everything” in terms of analysis. You’ve talked to enough other people to get their thoughts… You’ve had some time to think about the decision… You’ve maybe read up on it… These days, maybe you’ve asked ChatGPT (lol)… You’ve written about it a bit, and there’s clearly an option that your gut is telling you to go towards. On the counter, you can make a strong choice after barely thinking about it, and then realize that you tripled down on a horribly bad decision. I like to think of all of the Vegas shotgun marriages that have to be nullified every year as an example of why making a strong choice isn’t always the optimal move hahahaOnce you’re at that point, just commit. 1000% make your choice, don’t hedge too much. Or as many a startup / growth executive has said, “Burn the boats” (borrowed from Cortez’s expansion into the Americas, where when his army landed, he had the boats burned as if to tell the team: there is no going back now. This is our strategy). When applied to business, this is also — at the right time — sage wisdom. I’ve written many times about strategy being equal to choices (credit to Steve Goldbach, CSO of Deloitte)… What does this matter? When a company has a choice, say to enter a new market, and they hedge too much, “Ehh, we’ll put one person there… see what happens…” the strategy just might not work. Oftentimes, strategies need full backing (investment of time, people, talents + the right timing + all the other factors needed for a successful market campaign)… without full backing, you might not actually know if it works or not. I’m not saying that hedging is a bad thing — it is a perfectly acceptable thing to do while you are capturing data and perspectives…until a point. There comes a time when you need to double-down, make strong choices, and go get the hell after it. Your life is surrounded by examples of what has happened after a team has committed — whether it’s a technology product that broke through or the very country within which you are reading this letter. At some point, someone (or someones) made a strong choice and they committed more than their competition was willing to. Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. There are 55+ other letters on topics like this at exonomist.substack.comShareIn closing…I think what Brittny might’ve been saying underneath the simple + powerful “Make Strong Choices” advice was really to not half-ass something once you’ve chosen to do it. Lean into your choice. Own it. Be amped up about it, and then let that set the tone for how you’ll actually execute on your choice: with commitment and passion. I’ve found life to be more enjoyable in every way since I internalized this advice. It’s made me embrace commitment in many ways, including (somewhat comically): what to order for dinner. Whenever I’m sitting there at some new-ish, trendy restaurant and my friend is like, “I’ve heard the cod is just to die for”, but I really want the skirt steak… I really freaking lean into getting the skirt steak. I don’t have regrets about not ordering the cod. Comparison be damned, I wanted the skirt steak, my analysis told me that was the right thing for me, and I’m going to order it with some gusto. And when I order that damned skirt steak, I will look at the waiter in their eyes, taking an extra 1.2 seconds while I nod my head in self-affirmation, to say: I’ll have The skirt steak, and damn am I pumped about it. (If you think I wouldn’t actually do this, then you’ve never been to dinner with me. I 100% do this on a regular basis).Obviously the steak ordering thing is a bit ribeye-in-cheek, but the ability to make a choice and not look back is, I think, one of the great secrets to living a better, more full (eh! pun intended) life.Thanks for reading. I’ll be back later this week with another letter :)MD(P.S. Simi is expecting in September!!!!! And I’m in fullllll on Dad joke mode. You can expect that to permeate more of my writing, as well as pictures of me embracing Dad fashion…but you know: nerdy millennial cool (am I cool?) dad fashion.Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

I’ll probably meander off topic (because writing is a journey :))Structure: Meeting Vetri in June 2020Original goals for (professional) life“I’m just not ready to be a founder. I’m not mature enough”The typical career path I’ve seen people take to being foundersMy career path to that pointLessons learned from three years of a hypergrowth startup — musings on: (1) mindset, (2) growth tactics, and (3) personal productivityWhat comes next :-) It all starts in June of 2020, almost exactly three years agoIt was the early-ish days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a friend, Tanvi, had just warm introduced me to Vetri Vellore, the Founder and CEO of Ally.io. I took the call from our small apartment in Seattle, deeply debating whether or not to go back to Deloitte after a 3-month sabbatical to chase becoming a Partner or doing the scarier, far riskier journey of a startup.As I think back on those early conversations, I expected to meet a founder who would be super aggressive, maybe rude, definitely smart, and probably the kind of person to make quick, bold decisions. … Bold decisions like hiring someone like me really quickly, as long as I “nailed” the first interview. Whatever I expected melted away within two minutes of talking to this guy, and realizing that he was: responsibly aggressive (from a business POV), extremely kind, most definitely brilliant, and definitely not the kind of person to make quick, rash decisions. Over the next six weeks, I interviewed with board members, every member of the leadership team, folks within the organization, and spent probably 5-6 hours of time talking with Vetri about the company, the market, what the future could look like, and why it made sense (or didn’t) for me to join. It was by far the most intensive interview experience I’ve ever had. It balanced the need for speed, with radical honesty about my priorities and the priorities of the business and extreme care. After my six references came back to Vetri — all glowing from some people who read this newsletter! — his response to me was something akin to: “What is wrong with you? What are you not great at? All this feedback is glowing, but if you’re already this perfect then what can we possibly give you? You should come here to grow, and I’m not sure I fully now how to help you do that.” I loved this line of questioning, and it would lay the foundation for many sprints working together as a leadership layer, where we tackled everything with extreme openness. So, what did I say I wanted to achieve in my life? I told him two simple points that we’ve checked in on together over the last three years. “The way I see it, I’m going to do one or two things in my life, and potentially both over time…”I want to be a founder, and joining this company — working with you — will help me bridge the journey between megacap company land (Deloitte + clients) and the world of early-stage startupsI want to be a venture capitalist, to help founders achieve their goals, and working at a startup for 3-5 years is — I think — critical experience to ensure I can better empathize with foundersAt this time, I hadn’t yet achieved what i’ll call Vision Precision — a very refined, specific view of what I wanted to do. I couldn’t tell you what kind of company I wanted to build, or even what stage of venture capital I wanted to focus on. I just knew I loved business strategy, team building, and thinking about markets (how they’re organized, and how they can change). Anyways, the whole point here was that Ally.io was a way for me to build skillsets + gain experience working at a startup so that I could go do one of the above two things. Spoiler alert: I’m doing both right now, and have been doing VC work for a couple of years. More on that shortly.“I’m just not ready to be a founder. I’m not mature enough, and I think there’s probably a lot I don’t know.”This is almost verbatim what I told Vetri during the course of the conversatio around what I could possibly get from joining Ally.io …that I didn’t feel mature enough to yet be a founder. I pride myself on having extreme self-honesty, and that was the right call. I think many people are ready to go be founders when they’re 25 (or 19… or 18, even), but the average age of a successful founder is 45, and in talking with founders I knew at the time, the very best ones usually followed a path that looked like the below. Spend time in some job right out of school. Maybe it’s consulting. Maybe it’s finance. Maybe it’s marketing. Maybe it’s sales. Who knows.Find your way into a team building a new product or significantly extending the capabilities of an existing one, and find out you love it Maybe you went to business school (most of my startup/founder network hasn’t btw…And of all the VCs I know, I’d say maybe 70% of them have)Do some role where you get general management exposure. Maybe you’re working on strategy in some wayWork at a startup and/or found your own startup. You probably failWork at another startup and/or found your own startup. Maybe you fail again Your wallet hurts, so you go take a “big company” job and replenish your coffers beforeTry again at your startup, and maybe this time it works8A: you keep doing startups8B: you go to the “other side of the table” and become a VC8C: you retire and enjoy yachting around the world (I half kid here — I know multiple people who’ve done and/or are actively doing this!)8D: you decide to go back to big company land with the pedigree of having built businesses, and shareholders / board members want that transformation energy in their lives and make you a senior executive overseeing some business lineWhat what has my career path up until doing a 2nd startup (Ally.io)?Whether I wanted to or not (and I did want to!!), I worked at my family business from age ~11 to ~22. (See Letter 14: Ten Lessons I Learned Watching A Parent Build a Business)In high school, I got very good at producing music, and started making money at it. I learned about groundswell / grassroots marketing, product development, pricing, basic distribution, etc. I also realized how labyrinthine the world of music media law wasIn college, I DJ’d for about three years and made a bunch of money doing it! I learned about onboarding, customer experience (translation: managing the energy of a room), and voice of the customer capabilities (translation: very drunk college students telling you that your set was mind-blowing or completely sucked)In college, my good friend Jesse and I spent about 8 months trying to build a manufacturing logistics / IoT business, and quickly realized our commercial model wouldn’t work and also ran into serious challenges in product development. (Jesse is a total badass btw — that experience informed us both going into careers where we would learn about technology development)I joined Deloitte Consulting as a business technology analyst after having a last-minute panic about joining a very well regarded investment bank which, up until that moment in my life, had been one of my “first job out of college” dreams. I was thrown into the world of product development with a non-technical background. It was sink or swim, and I fucking swam my ass offI switched into Deloitte Strategy, promptly got my ass kicked, and then quickly grew. Eventually high quality work + strong recommendations from partners + some very very bold ideas about what Deloitte should look like in the future landed me a job on the CEO’s team. I decided that business school wasn’t worth it for me, and learned everything I could working with a management team. Eventually I went onto do an insane variety of strategy, innovation, and business building work. I realized, here, that I just freaking love designing new products, pushing them out into a market, iterating on them, and also mentoring + collaborating with amazing, smart people  I burned out doing strategy projects. A c-level exec at Deloitte remarked to me that “It only takes two…” (referring to two bad projects), and I had two rough projects. Extremely sexy work, but the working dynamics were awful. The hours were getting to be ridiculous, and the carrot of partnership — while getting closer at a very fast rate — was too far off for my tasteScroll up to the beginning of this letter, for when I met VetriBecause of the consulting + startup experience + extremely obvious passion for early-stage company building, Michael and Sean at Overline extend an offer for me to work with them as a venture partner at the VC firm Overline in 2021. I’ve loved every minute of working with them, and it’s 100% made me a better operator to sit on the other side of the table, so to speakI’ve done this while also working a full-time job for two years. So, yes: if you want something, you need to be prepared to hustle. Few things in this world are going to be given to you.Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis.

If you’re in it for the money / exit potential, you’re probably setting yourself up for disappointment. The vast majority of startups fail to exist after a few years, let alone “exit”You have to watch your competition like a hawk and adjust to what they do. Notably, however: you can’t be on defense too often. You need to be on offense as much as you canStartups are marathons. Sprinting marathons oftentimes leads to poor decision making and a notably more stressful work environment —> not great for creativity, employee retention, or durable growthYour people are everything, and not just the people you may manage. Be supportive to your counterparts, and always bring a positive attitude, candor, warmth, etc. to your partnerships. Oftentimes, “corporates” can turn into turf wars that are hyper political…where people are battling for scope. If you have this mindset and you join an early-stage company, you are probably introducing poison into that most fragile environment. Leave the territorial shit at the metaphorical startup doorWhen it comes to hiring, it should be “Hell Yes, or No” If you have fundamental reservations about a candidate, do not hire them. Give them a chance to talk through concerns you have, but you need to have an incredibly high bar when you hire. And NO that does not mean they went to an ivy league school or something (really don’t give a crap about that stuff). It’s about the person’s track record, how they show up, how they solve problems, their values, how coachable they are, and your ability to say with extremely high conviction that they will be additive (not destructive) to your culture and performanceYou can’t be everything to everyoneKnow your part of the market and focus on that market. Be careful chasing shiny objects that everyone else is chasing. When you choose to extend into adjacent markets do so thoughtfully and with controlled early testing… And remember that every extension into a new market has impacts on how you can position your overall company / how prospects and customers will see youGrowth tacticsNail your onboarding motions. Make them as easy as freaking possibleCapture feedback as much as you possibly can, but get good at filtering / prioritizing itIf your employees are going to be customer-facing, hire for empathy and work ethic. Also, don’t skimp on training + enablement. I made every single person on my team go through multiple “simulations” of various customer situations and gave feedback constantly. Over-index on coaching, especially in the early daysCustomer advisory boards rock. Bring customers together, let them meet each other, show them new stuff you’re working on, and allow them to become your advocates Extend the capabilities of your platform to expand your TAM, but make sure to wait until your entire team is sufficiently prepped and ready before going to market. You have to think about things like: Key talking pointsCollateral Support pathwaysFAQsHypercare customer support, especially for those earlier customers Always be Raising… awareness and capitalInvestor relations is a nonstop game. You should always be doing it, to some extent. Always be running ideas by folks you know, getting their feedback on what you’re doing… And when you do go out to fundraise, embrace focus in your priorities. Yes, it’s important to paint a picture about the massive market you’re going to capture, but it’s equally important to prove that you have the feedback cycles + focus on precision that yields a focused plan about how you will actually capture that TAM (total addressable market for those who don’t know that term)Use focused “work rooms” / workshops to go extremely deep into a single problem with folks from across your company. Do it regularly, and make sure you have all key people there — not just executives. Example: if you have a land and expand problem, then setup two hours and bring literally the entire management team + 1-2 people from each organization into talk through the problem, rapidly develop potential solutions, and then…Run a high/fast tempo to bring these ideas to lifeDo NOT do what my teams at Deloitte sometimes did, which was spend 8-20 weeks “designing” a future state. That is entirely too slow. Do it in 3-4 days, and then meet with the team on a 5th dayCarefully manage your burn and ensure you have capital to make a few bold bets. It’s imperative that you give yourself the capital needed to experiment with new functions, products, etc. Startups are, in some ways, an odds game. There is a zero percent chance that every thing you do will work, so you should bake in a moderate-to-high failure rate with new things you’re doing. Failure is OKEmbed time for reflection and learning into your strategic planning efforts Always “anchor back” everything you do to your Objectives and Key Results (Metrics). Keep the entire team oriented around your most important 2-3 metrics that matterMarketing thing: when building a new market, especially in work productivity, invest in analyst relations… The research firms like Forrester and Gartner and G2 that publish all of these lists of the “best companies in XYZ space” are very important to awareness + signaling to prospects Personal Productivity Control your calendar It’s so easy to just get “busy” but in early-stage venture, especially if you have an executive role, you must protect thinking timeCount your time caloriesReview your calendar regularly and ensure you’re investing your time wisely (see Letter #37 for a deep dive)Consider getting an executive coach and/or a therapistThey are two different things for two different use cases, IMHOMy executive coach was an invaluable source of wisdom + a safe space to process sometimes-sensitive mattersMy therapist has been a wonderful source of reflection and curiosity as I’ve worked through stuff in my personal life. And side note: being in any executive role means that you’re always being criticized, questioned, blamed, or thrown under the bus in some way lol…and invariably these experiences can be challenging to process. Therapy is a power move, because it shores up your emotional health + helps you grow in ways that can be life-enhancingInvest in great tools that multiply your productivity. For me those tools are: Superhuman for e-mailEndel for whenever I’m doing deep work (or writing Exonomist letters!!)Krisp for noise cancellationHeadspace for meditationCalendly for meeting scheduling Flow by Moleskin for drawing on my iPad / A good ol’ fashioned dry erase boardBe very proactive about feedback. Give feedback to yourself and run it by others around you to help you process —> improvePrioritize sleepWe have an Eight Sleep. It might seem insane to spend thousands of dollars on your mattress but considering we spend anywhere from 25-30% of our time in bed, it was totally worth it to invest in something that helps me/us sleep betterPrioritize fitness Movement is key. Taking walking meetings whenever you can. Carve out a bike ride. Go to the gym at least once or twice a week if you can. You should always be in a battle for movement, especially if you need to do a lot of creative thinking. Moving an average of 5+ miles per day for me has been probably the single most important factor to my strong impact on our businessWhat comes next: becoming a full-time founderAlthough I’ve tried to do a startup before, this is really the first time I’m doing this. It’s the first time, as an adult, where a startup will be my full-time job. But that’s maybe where this world is already different: what I’m doing is not a job; it’s a mission.That’s how I view it, at least. Because what we’re building is extremely important. If we nail our vision, the world will be different, especially for creators / pioneers building up our local neighborhoods. I’ll share more details in a dedicated letter in a few weeks that fully explains what we’re building and why, but for now I will tell you that we are building a platform to enable owners of high-performing local businesses to achieve more than they could on their own.But just like Ally.io was different than Deloitte, this next journey will be very different from the last one. For starters, I’ve often mused that “I’ve done zero to one…build new experiences from scratch” but one of my co-founders rightly pointed out that I really haven’t done zero to one yet. Zero is when no one knows about your product, and most people don’t care enough to use it. Many people probably think you’re fucking insane for leaving a very very good job to go build this thing, but you know it has to be built, and it has to be your team. Zero is when you have few or no customers, and maybe little or no product. Zero is when there isn’t a proven market for your product, and you don’t yet have product-market fit. Ally.io, for me, was not zero to one. It was… .50 to 1. I joined a team that had largely already achieved PMF (product-market fit), already had some functional structure in place (a sales leader…a marketing leader… a product and engineering leader… etc.), and already had two rounds of venture financing done. We had hundreds of customers (although we’re 5x our customer count to 1000 between when I started and when we were acquired!). In other words, Ally.io, although very early and very much still unproven, had traction and a viable path to success in front of it when I joined. What I’m doing now is different. It’s true zero. And I couldn’t be more excited about it. To close, the person who deserves the biggest thank you is my wife, Simi. While many many people have been extremely supportive, the reality is that I wouldn’t be doing this without her encouragement. My family is #1 to me, and I appreciate that when I started exploring this journey, she was nothing but encouraging. She’s consistently empowered me to “take the leap”, reminding me that even when we fail we learn. And you know, failure isn’t the only possibility. This freaking thing just...might...work.MichaelMore to come soon.

KARATE CHOP. KEANU REEVES BREATHING HEAVILY. SUITS. GUNS. LOTS OF GUNS. KEANU REEVES ON A MOTORCYCLE. WHISKEY. DUELS.This was what our evening looked like last week when my family and I decided to punctuate pizza night with a viewing of the recently-released John Wick: Chapter 4. I’ve long admired the John Wick series for its choreography, set design, pacing, and thoughtful use of its actors (Keanu Reeves barely speaks 380 words in the film, which implies that he made somewhere around $40,000 USD per word). In the film, one of the main characters utters a phrase I’ve heard over the years, but that I hadn’t quite internalized so potently until this week: How you do anything is how you do everythingI have to admit that I don’t typically love sayings like this. Why? Well, as a wannabe philosophy major (Humanities / Classics was close…), you can’t take this statement literally. What it implies is that you should do every single thing in your life with excellence and care, when that’s just not always feasible/wise. In other words, sometimes I just want to half-ass my run instead of pushing myself to channel my inner Usain Bolt. Nevertheless, something about hearing this quote at this time in life resonated deeply. I found myself thinking about these words over the course of several days, and at one point my wife uttered them as well. Why did this resonate? Here’s my working answer: I think the idea that you should do the very best you can in what you are doing is noble (reminder on the definition of noble: “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals”). It feels good to do your best, to take care in what we do, even when it’s something seemingly small. Here are some examples from the last week in my life… They’re not all “serious” but maybe you’ll get the point.Fun: Petting my dog with intention. Not just patting him and signaling to him to go away, but stopping what I’m doing, making full eye contact, and giving ol’ Tycho a strong set of pets, behind the ears, on top of his noggin’, on the belly, and underneath his chinWork: When sending out one last deliverable at work (which took me 10 minutes), instead of just sending it when I was done at marking it as a draft (“WIP”), I re-read the entire document, made edits, tested it for brevity and punctuation in ChatGPT, and then asked myself the question: “Does this feel like a very high-quality piece of work? Does it represent my best work?”Personal Finance: In our household, we’ve been on a fun budgeting challenge for the last year. As our work situations evolved, we found ourselves spending too much, so we’ve been progressively cutting our burn rate every month. To do that, we review our expenses 2x per week, self-govern our spending, we cut out things that don’t have strong justifications / aren’t giving us some kind of value or real joy, and we actually take time every week to talk about it. We’re more thoughtful about travel, meals out, unnecessary fashion expenses, etc. Note: this doesn’t mean we don’t spend. We do. We all do. But we really scrutinize ourselves before buying something. We make sure it’s something that brings us joy, and we intentionally delay things. Not because we need to, but because there is something powerful about delayed gratificationGratitude for others: My letter #003 was all about this, and it’s now been over a year since I’ve revisited the idea. Essentially, you can just say “thanks” or “appreciate it” when showing gratitude. Or you can be more specific: “Hey Wendy, I really appreciate that you not only took the time to proactively handle this issue, but that you took the time to make sure I was aware of the overall scenario”“Hey James, it meant a great deal that you prioritized getting this done today. You getting this over quickly is going to allow us to get back to our customer even faster, and I think that’ll go a long way in helping us to keep the partnership on great footing.” Essentially, are you going to half ass your gratitude for others, or are you going to take the extra 5 seconds required to go a level deeper? ShareFor new subscribers, Exonomist is raw, minimal or no editing, so I will sometimes meander… Like right now: how shitty is it to only get constructive feedback all the time? When something goes wrong, you hear about it over and over and over, and it can feel just awful. Why don’t we spend more time appreciating the things that are going well? I challenge every person reading this newsletter to give more gratitude to those around you — I can almost guarantee you’ll feel great doing it, and I have to imagine that in most cases you’re “going the extra half-mile” might brighten someone else’s day, or cause them to reflect on what they did to get such recognition. Alright, back on track here: I’ll update the quote with my own (certainly imperfect) version that I feel is more … literal. It borrows from another quote a colleague once told me (“you have to earn your leadership every day…”): Before you do anything, consider how you could do it 1% better than you did it last time, and do it. Embrace the joy of having pride in all that you do.When you’re on your run, you don’t need to go for a world record to feel good about it, but strive to do even juts a little better than you thought you could.When you’re building that model at work and you think it’s done and you’re just so exhausted with the task, step away for a minute, come back and review it, and review it with the lens of, “how can this be 1% better?”When the dishes are piling up in your house and you’re thinking, “god damnit, more dishes!?” (this is me every day), clean them and do one more pass on the plate or forks than you thought you needed.When you thank your team for their work, instead of just saying “Thanks team, really appreciate the work here” take the extra thirty seconds to call out what you valued about how the team showed up and performed. None of this is rocket science. It’s not that hard, and yet it can be so game changing for your mindset and for the environments around you. And if you’re not adding to the environment around you, then what are you doing?MichaelP.S. Thank you to all of my Microsoft colleagues who took the time over the last couple of weeks to do exactly what I outlined in this letter. You didn’t just say thank you, you went a level deeper, and it gave me a whole new level of warmth in my soul. You never really know what you mean to people unless they give you some signal of what you’ve done for them, and I was overwhelmed with signals over the last two weeks. I’ll never take for granted that people took the time to give me feedback, and although it didn’t have to be positive, it most certainly was. So to all of you who gave me that, thank you for the gift. The gift of your gratitude and your thoughtfulness. I’ll never forget it, and I’ll take it with me on this next journey of building this awesome company.

Positively reinforce bravery when someone highlights a problem, and work with them to enhance whatever solutions they may have brought up. Teams that lack this capability are most likely to achieve mediocre outcomes; not breakthrough ones.Imagine you’re sitting in a meeting. You’re physically in a conference room with 12 other people, and every one of you is going around reporting out on how your various projects / threads are going. One lady pipes up and says, “Well, things are going great for us this week. We finished phase 1 of our research ahead of schedule, we got great feedback from customers on our new concept, the team is working really well together, and we’ve been loving our partnership with everyone around the table here, including product, marketing, and finance. Overall, things are on track.” And that’s the end of the update. This is not a good update. This is a mediocre update. I didn’t say it was a bad update, but it’s certainly not an excellent one. This is not the type of update that will push the group to be better. It’s the kind of update that is meant to be fairly innocuous… to not draw attention, to make others feel good. To reinforce the good feelings you have. This has been me. It’s been me a lot. It’s been me too many times. Let’s dig into why this type of update isn’t particularly helpful. When you go to work, are you trying to achieve something differentiated? Are you trying to build something new, to make your team better? Or are you just there collecting your paycheck? Totally fine if you’re in the latter category, but I’m going to assume if you’re reading this, that you’re not someone who shows up, punches in the metaphorical clock, does the bare minimum, and punches out.****Eh, sometimes it’s OK to dial back a bit, depending on your situation. Maybe I’m being a bit too hardcore or something here by lambasting the people doing the bare minimum. I acknowledge that there is weakness in my POV, but will charge ahead nonetheless. There’s an old quote I’ve long loved (but haven’t always applied): “if you’re not pissing anyone off, then you’re probably not saying anything.”So if you want to achieve more, then you probably understand that it requires you to exceed performance in some area. There are three ways you exceed performance targets / expectations: ONE: You improve or build on a strength. #StrengthToStrengthTWO: You maintain your position in an areaTHREE: You address shortcomings and find ways to improve Here examples: ONE: Microsoft building on their cloud computing and business software leadership position and layering AI products on top, before other established players. #ImprovingTWO: Coca-Cola showing you the same types of advertisements so that you keep consuming their products. #HoldingSteadyTHREE: A team admitting that they are so concerned with being nice to each other, that they aren’t giving constructive feedback. #AddressingProblemsI first came across number three above back in 2015 when a colleague of mine, Jeff, mentioned this term Deloitte Nice to me. To be Deloitte Nice was to just be super positive all the time. To not give the constructive feedback. To not have the tough conversation with that person who keeps bulldozing other people’s POVs in meeting. To not take a moment to stop a meeting and make sure everyone’s on the same page. Etc. etc. This phenomenon was seen as dangerous to higher performance, and so the firm was making a bit of a concerted effort to to dial down the superficial niceness, and dial up the candor (…..annnnnnnd this is where I developed my leadership philosophy around being candid and warm, because candor without warmth or empathy or the ability to listen is a slippery slope to being what some may call an… ahem.. asshole).Alright, getting back on track here — if we want to exceed our own expectations, we have to be able to hit on each of the above three areas. We need to be able to build on strengths, hold steady where it matters, and shore up weaknesses. This is the foundation of winning any strategic game. It’s these three things, and really nothing else. The most efficient way to achieve a balance of these three areas is to ensure that your collaborations have elements of all three on a regular basis. So let’s revisit that update I gave above. Here’s a better version: “Well, things are going great for us this week. We finished phase 1 of our research ahead of schedule, we got great feedback from customers on our new concept, the team is working really well together, and we’ve been loving our partnership with everyone around the table here, including product, marketing, and finance. Overall, things are on track…”New Addition: …Although we are on track overall and there are some bright spots to call attention to, there are also some potential warning signs hiding underneath the surface. We’re already thinking of how to address these points, and I would love to invite you all to an optional “workroom” where we think through how to make sure we address these points of potential concern: First off, while we’ve gotten positive customer feedback, no customers have followed up on their positivity with action. We’re not seeing them taking any meaningful actions after we show them this concept. People aren’t even signing up. This might imply that maybe we’re not addressing a problem that is mission critical for customers. Secondly, while we finished our research phase ahead of schedule, we realized halfway through that we weren’t tracking a potentially super valuable dimension of study. We’re considering opening phase 1 back up and going back over to layer in this new dimension of data, but doing so will take an extra week. Thirdly, while our partnerships around this table have been really positive, we’re still having some challenges getting approval from Legal on a fast timeline. I know they’re bogged down with our enterprise contract review processes, but I would love if we could find a way to get just a little more time per week from them — maybe even just 2-3 hoursYes, these additions made the update longer, but it also made it far more actually valuable. While the first version made everything seem positive, the second version actually starts to tease out the truth, and to also tee up actions to take to improve. This is the foundation of shoring up weaknesses, and achieving more. It’s this. It’s this moment when you have the bravery to admit that your on track according to your project plan but not on track as it pertains to helping the business achieve more. Why am I choosing to write about this? Well, I’m a pretty positive dude. I’ve gotten tons of feedback over the years that I’m positive and energetic and kind. All things I appreciate, and certainly strengths that I want to keep building on. But all those comments mask something I’ve been practicing for many years: the art of bringing out the truth in a way that: (1) doesn’t throw people under the bus, (2) keeps outcomes top of mind for everyone, and (3) helps improve the functioning of an entire group. …Because when you give an update like the one I just typed out above, you’re telling others around you that it’s OK to surface challenges. But critically, the most senior leaders need to positively reinforce this! That three-point candor onslaught isn’t going to do anything positive if the senior leader of the group demonizes you or applies a ton of pressure to you. The people who bring up problems should be rewarded for their bravery, because it is not easy to be the person to bring up problems, and yet it’s the underpinning of a high-performing team and organization. Yes, ideally you’ll bring up problems and have at least some aspect of a solution to said problems / areas of concern, but it’s perfectly OK to say, “We’ve put some thought into this, but could benefit from some focus from the braintrust here as we improve our plans going forward.” I chose to write about this today because I’ve been reflecting a bunch on the skills I’ve picked up in the last few years, and undoubtedly the most important one has been the topic of this letter: being willing to surface problems or areas of concern. As my startup team and I have been diving into what we’re building, we are actively surfacing areas of potential concern. We’re quickly calling out when we might not agree, when there might be a better way, when we might not be on the same page, and it is freaking.excellent. It feels so good, because we know that with each conversation where we listen carefully + respond thoughtfully, we move closer to powerful realizations about how to bring an incredible experience to market, and how to actually achieve our north star outcomes. So what does this mean for you? You should strive to improve your culture. Your team’s culture…your company’sYou should strive to create an environment where problems can be surfaced, where the red “Off Track” indicator on a status report doesn’t lead to people getting shat on, but leads to the group swarming around the problem and ideating thoughtfully. If you don’t have this, you should talk to your peers / managers about it If they don’t listen, you should ask a senior leader how they think about thisAnd if you’re still stuck, leave a comment here or reply to my e-mail (many of you do, and it’s SO FUN to hear your thoughts) with why you feel like this can’t be done. I will personally respond to you and/or I’ll update this letter with additional tactics for how you can achieve thisAnd is this possible in every work environment? No. It definitely isn’t. I’ve definitely been on teams/cultures where what I’ve outlined would’ve never flown. … And I’ve learned to keep as far away from those cultures as I can, because the only thing those places will achieve is mediocrity.See you next week!MD(P.S. Would also love to hear anything else that has worked for others as they’ve dealt with this challenge in their teams. While some situations aren’t tenable, many are… What have you done to create an environment where you can surface shortcomings/risks proactively?)1Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#60: \"Red is Good\" - Why Surfacing Challenges is Critical to Winning Strategic GamesCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

My biggest ask is that if you’d like to be a part of the journey with us as a local investor OR as the owner / someone who knows high-performing local business owners, please join our waitlist here. Media: Hypepotamus Article, My LinkedIn AnnouncementIf you want to share Homegrown, you can simply share this article OR send www.joinhomegrown.com to your friends :)Share“What could have possibly caused you to leave your super high-paying job at Microsoft?” — Answer: life’s too short to not see what’s possible, especially when what you’re building could make the world a fundamentally more vibrant place.Tl;dr — Homegrown is a marketplace that connects owners of high-performing local businesses with local investors. Owners pay back investors with financing based on their revenue, and investor returns are capped at 2x. Why is this f*cking awesome? It allows local people to back local businesses they love. #SupportYourNeighborhoodBecause financing is based on revenue, it’s flexible for owners. Have a slow month? You’ll pay back less. Have a monstrous, record month? You’ll pay back more. No personal guarantees (so, no putting up your house or savings as collateral)For local investors, you can make up to double your money, but no more (as of now)We carefully vet each business. Quality is of the utmost importance to us, so we take great care to work with the top 10% of local businesses. We diligence companies much like a venture capital firm would before connecting local companies to our investor networkSo much more is coming in the future. We’ll be writing at www.joinhomegrown.com and I’ll also be publishing letters every so often detailing an aspect of Homegrown. Exonomist will not be changing focus, really. This newsletter is still going to be about the art of management (of ourselves, our teams, our organizations), but you can probably expect a few more examples that are from the trenches of early-stage company building :).1Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#61 - Launching Homegrown, My New StartupCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Or repetition. Let me break down my thinking a bit more with an example: becoming a chef. Now, I don’t really know much about the journey to become a chef… And as much as I love cooking food, I would probably fail at being a chef at a high-quality restaurant (I am terrible at following recipes or consistent formulations of food).But here’s what I can guess about the journey: At some point, someone realizes they love cooking. They love cooking so much that they want to make it a career pathThey consider going to school, but realize that they can’t bear the financial burden of goingThey decide to first work in a restaurant to gain some experienceThis is where most people just start blanket applying to restaurants (10 restaurants), probably online. They do the thing that everyone else seems to be doing, and they’re surprised and dejected when the results aren’t affirming. That is, when they don’t hear back from anyone. «HURDLE #1»If you want unusual outcomes you might need an unusual approach. Or maybe, better yet: you need to mix an unusual approach with repetition. Let’s keep bulleting out how this could work.After failing to get any traction from applying online, Fortuna (the name of our protagonist here) comes to the realization that she needs to go in person to restaurants to make an impression and increase her chances of actually talking to someone at a restaurantFortuna is feeling AMPED about her new approach, and decides to test it out on a few restaurantsFast forward a few days, and three restaurants have turned her down. She feels discouraged, she confides in her family/friends about the difficulty. This is where most people will give up «HURDLE #2»They give up after testing out something and realizing that this path, too, isn’t working. But this is abandoning ship way too early. Here’s how Fortuna is going to overcome the second Hurdle that eliminates most dreamers.Fortuna cold reaches out 10 chefs. One of them responds. When she gets that one phone call she asks about the chefs path, shares her dream for being a chef, shares the many points of failure she’s had, and critically: she asks the chef what she should do when approaching restaurants in person? “How do I stand out? What would make you give me a chance?”Fortuna gets some ideas, and now she’s ready to go at it again. Here’s what happens: Fortuna goes to three more restaurants and this time ONE actually says YES to granting her an initial interviewBut unfortunately her car broke down on the way to the interview and she showed up an hour late. She doesn’t get the second interview «HURLDE #3»UGH! FORTUNA! You just cannot catch a break! She’s experienced three sets of setbacks, and yet again this is where most people would stop. She invariably thinks, “Maybe i’m not cut out of for this.” But Fortuna then watches a movie about a star chef and becomes inspired yet once again (idk guys, just work with me here). Here’s what she does now: She decides to sprint for a week. She’s going to go to 20 restaurants, of which 5 will grant her an interview. Now she’s in businessEventually those five interviews yield 3 follow-up interviews, and she is able to get two job offersThese offers are to help at the front desk of the restaurant, but she’ll have the opportunity to learn more about how a restaurant functions, and now she’s in the game. She’s on the path. She’s started. I think life kinda works like this story. Sure, it looks different for you and for your friends, but generally the people who make it are the ones who are willing to jump over hurdles over and over and over again, but learn from their mistakes each time. This process of learning tends to be accretive (helpful), in that you learn lessons that will benefit you in future “leaps” you’re trying to make in your life. And the foundation of the results is repetition.In the above story, Fortuna reaches out to 40+ restaurants/people to eventually get to two real opportunities. That is a 5% “conversion” rate. And a lot of things go into conversion, not repetition alone but… Calibrated Repetition.From every hurdle, Fortuna learns something that allows her to adjust her next attempt. And this is what enables the achievement of dreams. The ability to run at an opportunity, know that it is statistically unlikely to work, and to keep doing it over and over again but with modifications regularly so that you might test and learn and achieve. This is how my brain works with almost everything, and it’s because that’s what I’ve done my whole life. My entire existence has been a story of repetition and failure and repetition and failure and repetition and… a breakthrough.Which leads me back to the title of this letter: Throw a Hail Mary Once Per Week. SubscribeThe thing I didn’t really accomplish with my totally made up example above was the mindset around making a bold attempt. For Fortuna to walk into a restaurant without knowing anyone there and asking for a job is really hard. To this day whenever I make an in-person cold outreach to a potential customer, my heart rate increases. You might not realize it from how it’s coming across, but I feel it emotionally. I feel it because I know this act of putting myself out there will likely lead nowhere, and that’s challenging. And yet it’s doing this on a regular basis that allows you to “unlock” different potential realities for your life. And so right now, as I’m building Homegrown, I’m throwing a Hail Mary Pass once per week. Maybe it’s to a customer, maybe it’s to a potential local investor, maybe it’s to an investor who I am not already connected to. Maybe it’s to a vendor. Maybe it’s to someone who I want to eventually bring on the team… Whatever it is, one time per week I do something f*cking scary, because sometimes…not all the time but sometimes, it works.To end this free write exercise, think about something you want to achieve, and ask yourself what you could do once per week to make it more of a reality? I’m not saying what will lead it to just magically happen. I’m saying what could you do right now or tomorrow that would bring you even 1% closer to that dream you have? Just do it. Go do it. Stop waiting. Stop thinking about it. Just try something, and do it regularly.Thank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis. This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareMichael’s quick appendix of things he’s done this with: Getting my first job — I reached out to probably 75 companies to get five interviews. Hurdle: most people declined me immediately without an interviewTransferring to different groups within Deloitte — Probably sent 200 outreach e-mails over 8 years, of which 25-30% responded, of which 3-4% became people I worked with. Hurdle: most people didn’t respond.Joining my first startup — I probably talked to 15 different startups, and met even more people thinking about building one. Most of the time I was told no for a wide variety of reasons, the most common of which being that I had never worked at a startup and there were concerns about my ability to build in that contextFinding my wife — UGH dating sucked. It was 10+ years of dating, making some progress, things not working out, feeling dejected… giving up… giving it another go, trying different apps, working on myself, working on myself, and eventually bam: I found my freaking awesome wifeMaking my first sales within consulting / startups — Usually entailed me awkwardly asking for someone’s business and being told no many times. Eventually I sought out very intense coaching on “How to be a top 1% of 1% sales expert” and kept practicing… kept building proposals, kept pitching, kept doing final selections with customers, kept learning, and eventually got pretty good at the art of the complex saleMy own startup — I built my own early versions of startups no less than 10 times and usually realized that the ideas just weren’t differentiated enough or that I wasn’t yet ready to run the full distance. Many of these concepts still permeate my thinking, and Homegrown is oddly close to some of them (#PotentialFutures)Venture capital — jesus it’s impossible to find seats at VC firms. Like downright impossible. Over the years I was ignored, denied, or given one of 10 reasons for why I wasn’t going to work out (the most common one being, “Our analyst program is extremely competitive with kids coming from (insert ivy league schools), and we simply had to make tough choices here”I did end up getting opportunities to join VC and PE firms throughout the years, but it only came after … an utterly ridiculous amount of hail mary’s and more non-respondes and rejections than I can count. But here I learned every time.Eventually I found a few people in venture who were willing to introduce me to other people in venture, who were willing to intro me to founders, who were willing to intro me to their VCs and so on and so forth, and eventually I found my way to opportunities (that for various reasons I ended up not taking), before eventually finding my people @ Overline, who were totally cool with me working with them while also holding down my startup role ==> allowed me to learn a RIDICULOUS amount in a very short amount of time doing both worldsShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#62 - You Should Throw a Hail Mary Once Per WeekCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Each experience teaches you how to observe, think, act, and learn from your actions.As I write these words, I’m reminded of this method the U.S. Air Force uses to go through this process of Observe —> Think —> Act. It’s called the OODA Loop.Here’s what an OODA loop is: ObserveOrientDecideActQuite simple. Let’s use it an example. You are in the middle of a negotiation. You’ve been talking with this other company for many months about a potential “partnership” (**Cough cough: acquisition**), and you’re nearing the finish line… Nearing it. You’re not quite there yet, and in these final moments what you say and how you say it is going to lead to one of three outcomes — Deal Won, Deal Not Yet Done, Deal Canceled. Here’s how to use the OODA loop to move thoughtfully: Observe — listen carefully, watch body language, note silence, note who is talking and who’s not talking. Are people looking at watches? Have they been listening to you talk for way too long (Exonomist #42)? Orient — How is this system laid out in front of you. Imagine a field of nodes, with each person representing a node, and perhaps they’re organized into two clusters. One cluster is yours, one cluster is the other team’s Start to generate hypotheses around how different actions might land with this group. Is this your moment to go for glory? To make an impassioned speech? (probably not)Is this your moment to stand up and throw a chair at the other team (probably…no, most certainly not!)Is this your moment to ask a clarifying question to someone who just finished talking. A question like, “…What I think I hear you saying is that the current structure of the royalty agreement is causing you anxiety because you don’t feel the multi-year targets are informed by a bottoms-up data model. Tell me where I’m right and where I’m off” Decide — You start to realize that path iii above is probably going to yield more information… and you also know that the other side loves when you ask questions because it shows that you actually care, so you decide to take this routeAct — You ask the question you thought about in the “Orient” phase. And now you’re back to the first step, Observe.And through this whole process you’re keeping in mind some outcome. At least you should be. Losing sight of your outcomes (what you want to achieve in this particular example) is when you start to just act without intention —> leads to sloppiness —> most of the time leads to sub-optimal results.ShareWhy am I writing about this right now?It’s week 5 of my latest attempt at entrepreneurial greatness. I can tell you that Michael this time is far, far, far more effective than Michael the last few times. My last startup was a wonderful learning ground where I honed in on skills that I am 1000% sharpening now, but my goal isn’t just to learn: it’s to build something enduring that changes the world for the better. If it sounds airy, that’s because it is, and I couldn’t be more f*cking serious about it.The reality of this journey we’re on is that every day counts, and outcomes build companies; not just aimless acting / outputs. I was talking to one of our team members this past Friday (you know who you are!) about the “secret” to achievement is in actually thinking about what you want to achieve, and then getting after it thoughtfully, and then pursuing maximum self honesty in how you actually did at achieving the thing. And if you have the bravery to be brutally honest with yourself, you are enabling yourself to get better at everything I laid out above in the OODA loop. The loop is only as valuable as the inputs. If you’re a shitty listener, and terrible at orientating situations, and not so creative with generating hypotheses, and terrible at testing of a hypothesis, then you’re probably going to get sub-optimal or terrible outcomes. ^^^^I think this is actually the most important thing about this thing we call “business.” You can apply this framework to basically every aspect of it. Think about it: Helping to make a drive-through run faster Helping a sales executive to get more meetings Helping a team to power through a tough interpersonal challenge Helping to resolve an internal political conflictHelping to create a new product that beats your competition Observe = what are they doing? What are they not doing? What did they do? Why do you think they’re doing it?Orient = Map the space. How is the marketing organized. Synthesize your observations and then generate some hypotheses — what do you think they will do? Decide = Pursue (that is, test) the hypothesis or hypotheses that you find optimal. This could be a marketing mechanism… a product mechanism… a legal mechanism…a financial mechanismAct = Build the feature or product. Launch the marketing campaign. A targeted promotion…Which leads me to the end here: in pursuit of actual results, the OODA loop is great, but it’s power comes when you maximize the thoughtfulness in the interstitial space between “observation” with “action.” If I were to explain this to a five-year old (hey kiddo, Dad just set a timer for five years from now hahaha), I might change it to be: Look! What’s causing what you just saw? What happens if you do X? Or Y? Or Z? Do X or Y or ZLook again and Learn…RepeatSee you in a couple of weeks! Shockingly since I’ve re-entered startup land, I’ve been 100% focused on building Homegrown, so a bit less time to write, but that experience alone is going to probably yield another 100 letters.Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

They aren't the same thing.Michael DavisAug 22, 2023Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#64 - Common Startup Mistakes: Broad Platform Plays from Day OneCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareTl;dr — remaining focused is key for early-stage companies. You should spend most of your energy innovating at the altitude that the moment requires…not on refining your pipe dream.ShareOne of the most common mistakes a startup can make is trying to do too much, too early. It’s completely logical that this pitfall is so common. Here’s how: Person has idea for a startup, because it solves a problem they have. Let’s say it’s a … point-of-sale system (a.k.a. checkout machine) for coffee shopsThey think no one else is doing this (…btw highly unlikely: someone else has almost certainly already tried to do whatever they’re thinking about)They start building some kind of product (most people fail here btw…because they never finish building. I’ve gotten held up here multiple times)Then they start talking to potential customers (“prospects”) about itProspect 1 says: I really want to be able to see my projected revenue for the weekProspect 2 says: I want to be able to get replacement baristas in quickly in case someone is sickProspect 3 says: I’ll use you if you have a feature to predict coffee input pricesProspect 4 says: I’ll use it if you have an integration with liquor distributorsEtc. etc. Most founders / founding teams will look at this and start adding things to their product backlog. “YES, that’s a GREAT idea!” or “Let me come back to you in two weeks and show you what it could look like…” are the kinds of things you might hear them say to a prospect, but I think this is such a mistake for most founders. The problem isn’t taking feedback — you should take feedback, you should note what prospects / customers are asking for. The problem is when you don’t have a clearly defined “box” that you stay within, and that feedback leads you to add on or try so many things that you start to lose what makes the original idea special. In other words, there’s a very thin line between enhancing your existing idea or just plain changing it. And because early-stage startups are really, in a word, experiments, you should strive to actually maintain some kind of coherent experimental structure… Controlling variables, and avoiding adding in too many confounding factors.This is something I’ve had to work on over the years, especially coming from the world of huge companies where “platform plays” are the move. And to be clear, this way of thinking oftentimes makes sense for Microsoft/Google/Apple, where they NEED to see many many billions of dollars of revenue to pursue a space, which usually means owning a platform. Ah, maybe I should define my language here…Let’s go with this hierarchy:Features: very specific functions (e.g., logging in to an app)Products: collections of features that fuse together to create value for a user (e.g., Instagram Threads — many features stack on top of each other to deliver this holistic experience)Platforms: collections of products that come together to address a lifecycle of needs (e.g., Microsoft Teams)Teams is full of so many other features and products that you almost never need to leave it for the use case of “Work”For the use case of Food, Uber Eats is a platform — they have: Drivers delivering food. They use the driver appPeople ordering food. They use the consumer appPayments featuresReview featuresMap / food discovery featuresTipping featuresetc. etc. Many startups begin with a vision of building platforms. This is totally fine, especially if you realize that winning platforms typically aren’t built in a year, and that your original end vision is almost certain to change over time. More startups should help their teams maintain hyper focus on things that are right in front of them — products. Building products people love. If you do that many times in one space, eventually you’ll earn the right to build platforms. And while I certainly love to dream of platforms, the future is made in the day-to-day building of products… And good products are dialed into a thoughtfully-chosen set of personas / users. They’re not built for everyone; they’re built for specific types of people who have specific needs. ShareOne reminder I’m giving to myself these days frequently is to: innovate at the altitude that the moment requires. Most moments require you to get very granular things done…or to complete “projects.” Focusing on how to do the things right in front of you better is where victory starts to happen. Example: finding a new way to tune your customer outreaches, or a new way to position one of the features within the product you’re building.Some moments require you to dream big and to think about what things might look like five years from now. It can be helpful to think about this, and to consider what you might do to create that future you want. Example: dreaming about the future of mobility when flying cars are more ubiquitous… and dreaming of building the next gen “electricity station” where you land way up in the sky, and while you charge your favorite local coffee shop is making your latte. This is not happening right now!! Recognizing the differences in these two things will allow you to remain focused and deliver high-quality thinking + outcomesSubscribeShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#64 - Common Startup Mistakes: Broad Platform Plays from Day OneCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Ask yourself why you feel fear, ask yourself what could have or will lead to a better outcome, and then dare to actually do that thing. Try to view each setback as an opportunity to improve yourself and the products you’re buildingHello readers!As you may have noticed, this “mostly weekly” newsletter has evolved to being more of a “every few weeks” affair. Why? Well, for one: I’m in the earliest days of building Homegrown (new website, check it out) while also preparing to become a new Dad. It has been one of the single most rewarding periods of my life already, and it’s about to get even more rewarding (and, quite literally, poopy). I also never viewed this as a “you must write every week!” situation. It’s always been a, “write fast, write raw, embrace imperfection, hit send, and get on with your life” kind of outlet. With that preamble done, I want to share some thoughts about mindset. Mindset is EverythingAs you already know, I think about this a lot. Every day. Multiple times per day, because I think your mindset is actually the single most important factor that determines what you do and don’t accomplish. I was reminded of this two weeks ago when I got the chance to hear one of my personal business heroes, Jesse Itzler (co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks and one of the founders of Marquis Jets and Zico Coconut Water). He wrote this book that I absolutely loved about inviting a former Navy SEAL into his home for a month (or something like that) on his journey to be able to run hundred-mile races. He’s an insane human being in the best way possible, and much of his personal philosophy can be summed up in one line: I Will Not Quit.Mmmmmm, yes. That is just so powerful and so instructive for overcoming challenges and/or seizing opportunities in your life. I Will Not Quit.This is what I’ve told myself for decades, pushing through challenges, and building on strengths. And pressing advantages in strategic games when things are going well. Always on offense.I Will Not F*cking Quit.This is what I tell myself every single day now, because the only more guaranteed in startups than the prospect of running out of funding is the presence of roadblocks, every single day. And our team uses roadblocks as a way to dial in and be better and better and better.Practicing the Art of Problem Framing Yields Good Things, Almost Endlessly How you choose to view a situation or problem impacts what next steps or solutions you will take. If you choose to view getting passed over for a promotion as a problem, you will likely feel stressed, betrayed, etc. etc. All emotions that, in some doses, can actually lead to productive results. In fact, feeling emotions like frustration is a perfectly healthy part of understanding a problem and understanding yourself (by asking, “Why am I feeling this way?” over and over again).But then…. Then there is this moment when you need to shift the framing from, “this is a problem. WTF” to… “This is an opportunity … to do something novel… and to show myself that I have grown.”I’ve experienced this literally every single day of the last 12 weeks. For several reasons, I won’t go into detail about these challenges, but I will tell you that we have overcome every single one, and every single setback or roadblock has made us better. One day when the market we operate in has matured a little bit, I’ll write about the specific scenarios our team managed through in these early days, but for now I’m going to instead be vague and talk about how to apply this “Opportunity Framing” mindset to something at work.The next time you feel friction or the fear of failure at work, lean into that fear. Ask yourself why you feel fear, ask yourself what could have or will lead to a better outcome, and then dare to actually do that thing. Examples: Instead of blaming your manager for not getting a promotion, ask yourself why you weren’t promoted — “What could I have done differently to change this outcome?” View yourself from a third person perspective, be critical, and then ask yourself, “If achieving this thing meant keeping my job or losing it, how would I go about getting results?” Spend time on this question and you are likely to uncover something you aren’t doing…and that is the foundation of actually doing something differentIn other words, you’re viewing your situation as something in your control, and you are taking controlInstead of saying you “lost the deal because the customer wasn’t willing to pay our pricing premium over this other SaaS product,” dig into what you could have done differently at literally every pointWere you thorough enough on discovery? building relationships? Did you understand the customer’s problem? Did they ascertain the pure power of what you were selling? Did you communicate clearly enough? How was your energy / vibe during your meetings? Assume you have margin for improvement in every category, what do you change? If you will not quit until you achieve what you want, then you must also not quit at finding out where you need to evolve yourself. Because if you don’t change yourself, you are just waiting on the universe around you to change, and to deliver different results. Sure, that might work over a very long period of time, but it’s highly unlikely to get you the results you want on a faster timeline.  (This applies to corporate / company strategy & execution as well)And time is our most valuable asset. Tomorrow is never guaranteed. “Later” is never guaranteed, so stack these two things together to go achieve whatever it is you want in your life: I Will Not Quit.Why Not Now?Michael(P.S. Baby boy coming very soon, so probably won’t write again until October :-)).(Self feedback: I’m not reading over this before hitting send, per usual. But as I wrote this, I felt intense. I felt amped. That’s because I’ve been feeling that way every day. I know that what we’re doing both in our personal and work lives is important, and that we have to win. We have to progress. There is a healthy urgency around taking advantage of every single day, and it is enthralling. Now, what I didn’t write about here was energy management… You can’t sprint marathons without risking serious injury, and I really don’t like being injured. So, we balance out this higher state of intensity with even deeper rest during our replenishing times. My family and I still have a habit of ditching our phones on weekends. We still make sure we have at least one day per week of MAXIMUM LAZINESS. We prioritize a healthy-ish diet, sleep, and fitness above almost everything else… And because we do those things, we can show up 5-6 days per week with gusto.Each of these letters is a snapshot in time of so many things. Some will be more preachy / Nike commercial-esque like this one. Some will be more research oriented and plain)Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#65 - Viewing Friction as the Spark of Personal & Strategic InnovationCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Michael DavisOct 16, 20238Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#66 - Learning to Love Tradeoffs + Some Tactics to Reclaim Your TimeCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShareNote: I’m a Dad! Our son was born late in September. We absolutely love him. Being a Husband, Father, and Founder takes time, and as such I’m moving Exonomist to being more of a monthly fun exercise. There may be a time when this gets back to being “(mostly) weekly”, but this is what the times call for. Just like I’m writing about tradeoffs this week, the tradeoff I’m making here is to do Less of one thing so I can do More of other things… And as I’ll be writing about below, sometimes less is more. Embracing tradeoffs can be magical.TL;DR - Embracing tradeoffs can force you to find new ways of living your life that can ultimately help you have a more fulfilling existence. Since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated with the concept of a trade-off. This is likely not a new term for you, but let me define is simply for the sake of clarity: a tradeoff is the change in value an actor experiences by picking one thing over another. That change in value can be binary:I want to do X, so I can’t do YBut oftentimes what happens in actual life is: I am going to do slightly more of X, which implies that I will do slightly less of YOf course, you can do incrementally more of X (and thus incrementally less of Y) until Y no longer happens at allThese tradeoffs are happening all around you, every day. You’ve probably made a hundred tradeoffs today alone by the time you’ve read this. You choosing to read this letter means you’re not doing something else. One way to think about tradeoffs is in how you spend your time. Here’s an example of tradeoff exercise I had to do nearly three years ago when I met Overline for the first time. “I want to build my venture capital skillset, but I don’t want to leave my full-time job at rocket ship startup because it gives me a ton of joy and also financial security.” The tradeoff here was in the actual hours I had in the day. The GPs (general partners) at Overline were willing to collaborate with me in my spare time (without me leaving my full-time job), but that meant less “free time”In this situation, the tradeoff was to pursue a very very rare opportunity to help fulfill a life goal / mission, and with two of the absolute finest human beings I have ever met personally and intellectually. Most people would’ve said No Way to this arrangement, but I didn’t because I came to realize that the tradeoff wasn’t really a tradeoff. Why? Well, I was already spending at least one hour per day reading up on startups, venture, and entrepreneurship as a topic more broadly. So to find the time for Overline, I simply cut back on reading about these topics to actually practice more. Additionally, I found other dimensions from which to TAKE time from. Here are other things I cut: I stopped checking Instagram every day. To this day, I only log onto Instagram once per week, and it’s for barely more than 3 or 4 minutes at a time. I go to the same three chats whenever I’m there, and then I log off. Yes, this means I miss many life updates from friends, but if the news is that important and you really want me to know about it, you would have sent me a text on it (TIME SAVED: ~35 MINS)I shifted my general learning time into workouts — during runs, cycling sessions, walks. I started listening to more podcasts and audiobooks (TIME SAVED: ~20 MINS)I forced my core work schedule into a tight box and dared myself to find ways to do more with less time —> forced me to learn how to delegate more effectively, how to be more clear about assignments and outcomes, and how to structure my calendar hyper effectively into categories that I wrote about in the earliest Exonomist letters — GSD, GND, GTD (Get Shit Done, Get Nothing Done, Get Thinking Done). I also learned to be brutal with prioritization in a way I didn’t know was possible before. (TIME SAVED: 1 HOUR)I stopped texting as much. It drains my energy to stare at message boxes waiting for responses, so I simply don’t anymore. Texting is like e-mail for me — I check at set intervals for the most part when I can dedicate full intention to a message (TIME SAVED: ~20 MINS + MORE FLOW STATE TIME)I shifted catch-ups into more phone calls with friends + prioritized doing trips or seeing people in person for meals, walks, or visits Luckily, it seems that most of the people I speak to regularly also do this with non-urgent communicationsIf you add all of this up, I basically found a way to recapture over two hours of time per day. That’s how I made doing two jobs work. That’s how I found a way to dramatically increase my rate of learning every week for years, and that’s not even the best part.SubscribeThe best part is that I started to be way more deeply focused on whatever was right in front of me. Because I knew there was limited time for things, I super duper invested in focusing on whatever I was doing. In general, I don’t like to half-ass anything, even responding to a text message. And in focusing more, I found new ways of looking at moments in time. Put another way, imagine you’re in an art gallery — the MoMA in NYC. If you look at a piece of art for 15 seconds, you’re getting a lot. … But what if you were to gaze into that work of brilliance for 3 minutes. If you are focusing, you’ll probably find things about the piece that you didn’t in the first 15 seconds. You’ll derive more from it. Now, imagine if you did that with every piece of art in that particular gallery. Let’s say there were 10 works of art you’ll do this for in that gallery. That’s 30 minutes. But that’s a very very focused 30 minutes that allowed you to glean more from that particular experience than if you had only done 15 seconds per piece of art. Apply this to your life and what you do, and you might discover that…Embracing tradeoffs can force you to find new ways of living your life that can ultimately help you have a more fulfilling existence. By choosing to spend more time in that gallery, yes: you’ve spent less time exploring other galleries, or you’ve taken away time from other things you want to do. Sometimes you want to “skim” and that’s great, but “skimming” on the things in your life that are important to you … and skimming as a habit can leave pretty awesome possibilities undiscovered. One more place this embracing of tradeoffs can be powerful is in business strategy. I’m a broken record on this but strategy is about choice. WAIT, CHOICES —> TRADEOFFS?! YES. Here’s an example of how embracing tradeoffs could lead to better outcomes in business. Situation: You have $150k to spend on growth. You can spend it on a sales FTE (full time employee) or a marketing FTE or an operations FTE who will help you track all of the workstreams in motionThe potential mistake in this situation is to actually make a decision using the options provided to you. I recently asked a potential hire this question to see how they responded, and the answer was, “Sales because sales is what provides revenue.” This wasn’t a bad answer, but it missed an opportunity to ask discovery questions —> to learn more about the fictional situation —> to potentially develop creative solutions. Here’s a better answer: First ask the question, “What is the business trying to achieve broadly? What about across each of these functions — sales, marketing, ops? What is the talent capability like there today? Is there any budgetary flexibility?” etc. Then add a constraint, for example: “What if I only had $15k — 10% of that amount — to get the same results?”You might realize that you don’t need a full-time marketing strategist on the team. You need someone to execute campaigns, and you would like to have a marketing guru available. Maybe you could consult with a marketing expert and hire them on a contract basis to help develop your strategy, and then also contract out the marketing operations / execution work… Which leaves you with more budget to hire a sales FTE. Maybe you can actually do both. In other words, maybe the tradeoff here isn’t so dire. In fact, is it possible that you can find someone who has sales experience, but also really enjoys operations? (The answer here is Yes. You can. You definitely can). And do you actually need a FTE to run your workstream tracking? In this modern technology-defined era, are you going to tell me you can’t adopt one of the hundreds of softwares that help you to automate most of the work here? Don’t know how to get this setup? Go talk to people like my friend Ernesto Mandowsky who runs a consultancy to help companies do this. He’s not cheap, but he’s also not as expensive as that expensive operations hire you were just thinking about making (BTW, Ernesto is top of mind because I introduced another close friend to him earlier today — I am not paid for referrals. I just actually know he’s great at what he does)The situation above is of course tightly constrained and espouses the value of fractional work and automation… But there are of course times when you need to make FTE investments to build longer-lasting capabilities. Outsourcing everything is dangerous. Outsourcing some things is smart. When you outsource what — and to what extent — changes over timeComing back up to a slightly higher altitude for a second. I’ve long loved the whole saying “do more with less” … which has definitely been something many big company executives have been espousing for the last couple of years amidst a tighter monetary environment (Satya Nadella says this all the time, and he’s not the only one…). I like the idea of forcing yourself to be creative with whatever you have, and/or finding places to recapture time to re-allocate to higher-value things. In the end, what freaking value am I getting from scrolling on social media for 45 minutes per day? Yes, I totally get the need to “decompress.” If this works for you, keep doing it. But know that spending 45 minutes there is 45 minutes you aren’t spending on something else that is potentially more energizing or fulfilling. As always, moderation is important. Sometimes you just need to be a complete potato and just scroll reddit for an hour (…I definitely do this from time to time), but being self-critical about things like that becomes habits is the insight here. Dig into habits — things you do regularly — to find opportunities to reclaim your time. And from a business strategy perspective, dig into preconceived notions / established norms your company has around how to get things done and think about what you’d do if you have 50 or even 90% less time or resources to accomplish the same goal. Startups all over the world are doing this every day, and winning.MichaelThank you for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis.

Been a while. New Dad life + Homegrown has been all-consuming, and I have a backlog of Exonomist topics to write about. I’m currently on a plane to South America and find myself with an extra hour to write a raw, maybe-meandering letter. Hope you enjoy!Tl;dr — To better solve problems & achieve outcomes, people should embrace talking about the same topics over and over again to uncover previously unseen angles. If you have the patience to circle around the same topic over and over and over again across multiple conversations, there’s a good chance you’ll find a better way forward. And this better way is the key to achieving more.Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeHow many times have you heard the words, “we’ve already talked about this…” with the somewhat-unspoken insinuation that you should stop talking about this topic? I feel like I have consistently been in this position at least once per month for the last decade. Oftentimes we acquiesce to the social pressure of the group at the expense of that nagging feeling inside our brains that says, “….argh this was worth talking about.”Have you thought about what happens when you don’t bring up something that is important to you? Let’s work through an example now, but first a definition on how I think about solving problems & achieving outcomes.How to structure a creative process: No need to read everything. Just read the bolded text to get the main points.Consulting gave me many many good habits and power skills, and one of them comes from a group I worked in for a couple of years called Doblin. Doblin was/is an innovation consulting firm that basically productized the entrepreneurial process. One of the most significant brain upgrades I ever experienced was onboarding for Doblin projects, which introduced me to this lifecycle of creation they called the Innovation Process (or something like that); First, Frame the ProblemThen, Discover as much as you can about problem spaceThen, Create concepts that might solve the problemThen, Design what these concepts look and feel likeThen, Develop the thing you designedThen, Test the thing with actual usersThen, Launch a minimum viable version of the thing you developed and tested, and finallyThen, Scale, first to a small set of users, then to a larger group, then to a larger group, etc. etc. The power of this framework isn’t in following the steps so academically; it’s in spending an inordinate amount of time on the first two steps. When you take time to frame and discover more about a problem, you’ll see more of its contours. Here’s an example of how to see more from something, using one of my favorite literary devices: the automobile. Here are two ways of looking at an automobile: Approach 1: it’s a car. It gets you from point A to point B. It works. Cool. Approach 2: this car is a vehicle with a cabin and a powertrain and thousands of parts that all come together to enable me to move faster than I ever could on my own two feet. A typical car has many different sub-systems that come together to operate a larger overall system that we call a Car. These sub-systems are many, and include things like: tire system, steering system, stabilization system, propulsion / engine system, exhaust (if applicable) system, temperature control system, brake system, emergency response safety systems, etc. Each of these systems must interact with one another, and we use technology to manage these interactions. Wow, so many sub-systems. I’m going to now go research each system, how it works, why it isn’t 100% efficient.I’m also going to go talk to 2-3 experts in each sub-systemThen I’m going to talk to potential consumers of this entire system and ask them 20 questions about cars — what they look for, why they buy, why they don’t buy, what they enjoy, what annoys them, etc. Approach 2 takes way takes way more time to get through, but undoubtedly you will learn more from taking this path as opposed to the first. I’m not suggesting that people only operate in Approach 1 or Approach 2 mode, but that there’s a spectrum between these two extremes, and that more people should spend time deploying characteristics of Approach 2. OK, let’s pull back up to the prior topic of why it’s important to use more of Approach 2 whenever working through a problem / topic that’s important to you.What happens when you don’t listen to that voice inside of your brain that wants to keep bringing something up?A few things can happen: You can feel stifled. Suffocated. Like you can’t express the thing you want toYou might fail to contribute a valuable point of view to the conversational mix, which could mean that You might not find that beautiful, elegant path forward that was almost certainly there. It was so close, and a reason you didn’t discover it was because you gave up in the search, which could lead to…Your ability to bring up challenging or contrarian points of view to atrophy, whichCan lead you to become a “yes” person who doesn’t contribute anything new or valuable to conversationsImagine the cost of letting this happen? Think about the costs for your teams, for your relationships? Maybe for you the cost actually isn’t that high, but in my brain this is one of the highest costs to be paid.…But to create consistent space to bring up almost anything, you need to be in a culture that promotes itAnd this takes work. It takes work to reassure the people around you that uncomfortable conversations are GOOD, and that they are a sign of progress. And that progress feels so freaking messy sometimes, and that we humans don’t tend to love messes. Just like you work to learn a language, you need to work to learn how to create safe spaces around you, and the work is never done. The work continues on infinitely. You’re never done creating your culture, whether it’s at home or at work.To find the better way, you must be prepared to talk a lot — “you just have to talk a lot.” One of my co-founders, Dave Payne, is a bit of a startup legend in his own right in Atlanta. He has all sorts of unique ways of thinking and working that are wonderful, and one of the things we’ve been talking about a lot over the last few months is the importance of talking entirely too f*cking much about topics of importance to you. We have this app, Voxer, that we use to communicate as a team. It’s an old-school app where you leave sometimes-very-long voice messages, and then respond to said messages over time. It allows us to basically communicate without being interrupted and without responding to all the social cues that you would get by talking about something live —> which promotes more authentic, independent thinking that is less influenced by in-conversation social pressures. Here’s an example of what our conversations look likWe don’t just talk on vox. We are texting about the same set of topics almost all the time. We’re talking about them on unscheduled phone calls. We’re talking to each other in person. We’re sharing memos we write, graphics we draw. We’re talking to other people about these ideas, and we’re doing a metric ton of research to sharpen our points of view. We are embracing the fact that we have different views and opinions and channeling the merits of everyone’s ideas into the creative process. It’s intense. It’s what some might consider excessive, and it works. When we invest this time to talk way too much, we’re finding new contours of ideas and those contours become the foundations of new things we build together. It’s a messy process, where emotions can (and should!) run high at times, but it undoubtedly leads to a better outcome than, “we talked about this already, it’s done, let’s move on.” At least that’s our experience. End PointsThe thing you should avoid is prematurely shutting down discussion of a topic when there’s probably more left to uncover about itAt no time ever in history does any one person know everything. At all times your point of view is broken or undeveloped in some way, and your mission should be to find the ways that it is, so that you can rebuild yourself to shore up / improve what might be brokenAnd lastly, things change. Maybe you did talk about the company’s new product positioning a month ago, and maybe marketing is already moving on creating campaigns for it, but maybe something happened in the last month that makes all the outputs marketing is doing a waste of timeAnd when time is all that we have, don’t you want to spend it well? If you’re already putting 500 hours into a project, why not make that 540 hours to make sure you’ve spent more time exploring the entirety of an ecosystem around a topic? One question I’ll write about later: what I’ve described could easily be labeled “strategy spin” where people talk and talk and talk and never do anything. I’m aware of the critique and will come back to it at some point soon I will admit, this is probably overkill for most people. Totally get that, and maybe you have a better way to get to what I will call “Apex Creativity” but I’m increasingly convinced that the way of thinking and collaborating that I’ve written about in this letter is probably the way for most people creating new things and/or pursuing an increasingly meaningful relationship on the personal sides of their livesThanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

Our tendency is to focus on the negative aspects of a situation or life itself, even when so many good things are all around us, too. In these moments and periods of preoccupation with the negative, I have long practiced visualizing the extremes as a way to rebalance one’s self. Here’s how it works: Think for a moment on where you are at this exact moment. Are you happy? Sad? Average? Frustrated? Overjoyed? Note where you areTake 30 seconds to visualize the absolute best possible version of your life in this moment. What could be better? Take another 30 seconds to visualize the absolute worst possible version of your life in this moment. Could it be any worse? If it could, think about it and go to that placeNow, only after you’ve imagined the Best and the Worst outcome, chart where you are right now, and reflect on where you are on this spectrum of Best to WorstIn most cases, a person does this exercise and realizes that things are probably pretty good right now. Even on a horrible day where many things have gone wrong, you know it could still be worse, and yet it isn’t. Which leads me to the final point of this very short letter: perhaps these are the good old days? Perhaps is the operative term here. Everyone is going through their own journey, their own peak, their own trough, their own average. Maybe you’re in the dumps and maybe you actually are closer to that “Worst” extreme I mentioned above… But maybe — just maybe —  you’re also closer to the other, more positive extreme than you allow yourself to appreciate. It’s a personal question with personal answers. I don’t know what your truth is, but it’s worth meditating on where you actually are right now. If things are great, relish it. If things are bad, use that brutal realization to spur action to change your future, so that when you ask yourself that question again in a year, you give a different answer.

It’s because there was some moment when I realized what I’m about to share, and it was a bit of a “mental unlock.” It didn’t fully rock my world or anything, but it added a nice mental model to the ol’ noggin arsenal. I’ll try explain more now. I’m going to come back to this theme a few times, because I’m certain I won’t nail how I think about this fully in a short letter.Psst: Don’t let the title fool you into thinking this letter is going to be drowning in negativity. I think it’ll be quite the opposite.Start time: 4:01pm (taking a break from Homegrown for a bit)TL;DR — Embracing the reality that all things have room for *real* improvement is what creates the possibility that tomorrow might be better than todayI’ve always been preoccupied with the concept of entropy, or in laymen’s terms the likelihood for disorder to occur. Entropy is all around us, things are always moving towards states of change and disorder. Your kitchen is a great example of this. Think about that feeling you get when your counters are clean, there’s not a single dirty dish in sight, and that candle burns with your favorite scent. Does this state last forever? Hell no. Soon, that entire carton of ice cream just had to be eaten, and a bowl appears. Then a glass for your water. Then a pan for the pasta… Before you know it, the components that were once in an orderly state, are now taking up all of your counter space. And it will take work to get it back into an orderly state. Only for disorder to occur again. This is the nature of things. The very same pattern is happening everywhere else in your life, too. Things take work to maintain — relationships, your health, that product you’re working on at work… Without attention and care, things atrophy. Tools decay / depreciate. Products lose their relevance and sales drop. Your relationships may start to show signs of decay. It all takes effort and the bravery to change.If you accept this premise — that all things take work to maintain or improve — then a next logical question is:  Screw it, I’m having a beer while I write this. Hold please. … Alright, it’s 4:10pm nowAhem, the next logical question is: how do you improve things, given that disorder / decay are always happening? Where do you begin?How do you make things better? Of the many ways to approach this question of how to make something better, the way I have started to prefer is to embrace the stone-cold reality that said thing has room for improvement. That, to some degree, every thing around you is broken, you just might not fully realize it yet.People who have worked with me probably grow sick of hearing me say, “there is always margin (of improvement) to uncover!!” Our jobs are to mercilessly discover where to improve. … Like a Formula One racing team finding that .015% adjustment to downforce and realizing that the car will now go .002 seconds faster is what we’re constantly hunting and building for. Maybe that minor adjustment on its own won’t win you the race, but stacking improvements like this over and over and over again, day after day, week after week sure might. ((Go read Exonomist #44 — “Companies as Experiments…” — there’s a paragraph about how winning companies stack innovations. This last sentence is basically the same idea)). Let me pause to create a bit of a logical chain, using your team at work as the main object.Do you think your team is perfect? Of course not. So, you agree that your team is imperfect? You agree that something is not, plainly put, optimal? —>  Because your team isn’t perfect / optimal, this means that something is not workingWhen something is not working, we oftentimes use the word “broken” to describe the lack of that thing’s functionalityJust because something is broken doesn’t mean it’s entirely broken. It might just be somewhat broken. And it is better for us to accept that some things are somewhat broken, so that we might discover the way to make it better. We should also accept that sometimes things are essentially completed broken, and beyond repair.In other words, your team might be freaking amazing. You love how people communicate, you enjoy being around them, but invariably as your team goes through systems and situations that all have a tendency to decay / move towards disorder, things break. Weaknesses appear. You nurture the good stuff, while investing time on improvement the not-so-good stuff. This is management. And sometimes, this means that the composition of your team must change, because something — or some dynamic — is so broken as to be beyond repairing or, to borrow from the world of automobiles, totaledSo, my somewhat-modest proposal is that we should all accept that the things we work on our broken, to *some* degreeLet me give you an example of how this has been valuable lately for me. As we’ve built up our company, we’re constantly building new things. New products, new features, new approaches, new messaging, new, new, new, new. All the time we’re testing new things, and as we deploy new things we get feedback. Sometimes that feedback is good, sometimes it’s not-so-good. The parts that aren’t good signal that something might be broken, but the parts that are merely good also aren’t perfect, which means they might also be a somewhat broken. This way of thinking allows us to constantly re-assess every part of our model, which allows us to experiment with sometimes-bold changes frequently. These experimentations give us learnings, these learnings are helping us to win, more, faster.Instead of trying to constantly defend why something is perfect, we embrace that it isn’t, and it allows us to be honest about how to make things better. And by employing this nonstop, 24/7, we’re testing and learning faster. And when we get stuck, we call on people we know who are excellent at what they do (shout out to my advisors, Ian and Allen, among many others), who quickly will tell us: “Yeah, that’s not it. You should try ______”And in those conversations, that were started because we believed something was a little or very broken, we find the foundations of our future. ShareEmbracing the reality that all things have room for *real* improvement is what creates the possibility that tomorrow might be better than todayAnd look: this stuff is hard! It’s not easy to look someone in the eyes and say, “This isn’t working” …and yet that’s where the real progress occurs. When you do the hard thing, have the hard conversation, and begin to move forward with a more complete view of how to make tomorrow’s outcomes better than today’s. I was listening to some podcast last year where some VC guy who was completely full of himself uttered a nugget of wisdom, something along the lines of: the times of his career where the most groundbreaking leaps happened was directly correlated with the number of difficult conversations he had. This stuck with me over last year, and sure enough I realized that: The toughest conversations my (freaking stellar) wife and I have had are the ones where we tend to grow the mostThe hardest conversations I’ve had with my cofounders and team are the ones where we’ve realized the biggest jumps in thinking and/or have grown more effective as a unitThat most difficult moment when you need to let the person who is toxic on your team go is the turning point when the rest of the team was finally able to move forward with less of a “tax” on their energy and focusSome of the most direct and personal feedback I’ve received (which has been a gift) is what led me to feel like shit, but to think about why I felt like shit, and to figure out how I might feel a little less like shit about it over timeIn all of the above situations, something was broken, and we had the bravery to confront what wasn’t working. Which leads me to the final idea / suggestion for you to consider (…consider does not mean “utilize” — it means you’ll think about it): You should find the courage to call out when you think something is broken. Yes, you’re going to likely face some kind of friction or discomfort, but this is usually required to really achieve something meaningfulOf course, there are ways to do this with elegance. You don’t need to go full Elon here and ruin somebody’s psychological foundation in the name of progress; you can call for the fixing of what is a little or very broken in a way that respects the emotional investments others have made into a thing, because nobody likes to have their baby called ugly. Alright done at about 4:55pm. I don’t think I nailed the messaging here. There’s a potency that isn’t translating from my (admittedly-tired) brain to the page right now, but this is a sufficient starting point.MDSubscribeAPPENDIX OF ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS.This (the fear of being radically transparent in calling out things that aren’t working) is one of the absolute worst parts about big companies by the way. And no, I don’t mean the easy stuff like, “we could be better about adhering to timelines.” While improvements like this are important, I’m alluding to the bigger, riskier stuff like telling that toxic person, in a 1-1, that their behavior is causing real emotional churn for a high number of people, and that you would like to work with them on ways to communicate differently.  At some point, groups grow so large and politics becomes critical to people’s survival / livelihood, which can undermine the incentive for people to actually say the hard thing. God forbid you piss that VP / Partner off, man: what’s going to happen at your year-end review???? What of the state of your alliance with that VP’s team?  This isn’t a great setup, and it leads to cycles of mediocrity and strategic paralysis, where people aren’t really innovating anymore. And who can blame them? It’s hard to jeopardize your career foundation, when that foundation is enabling you to live / fundyour life.Thought leader / founder / investor David Cummings wrote over the weekend about “The Rise of the Forever Lean Startup” (I recommend reading it!). I loved how he talked about the benefits of forever lean teams that don’t grow too big, primarily because in smaller, tighter-knit cultures, it can be easier to reach the levels of candor and psychological safety where you can consistently practice this approach of “Everything is (somewhat) Broken.” This is what I have always strode to build — teams and cultures where very smart people can disagree and criticize, while also enjoying being around one another. It’s a hard thing to achieve at all, let alone maintain, but I know it’s possible.  Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#69: Everything is Somewhat BrokenCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Think about how freeing this idea is? One of the more taxing aspects of my 20s was this constant pressure to “achieve” something at a young age. If I’m honest with myself, half of my sleepless nights were caused by this underlying root. And while those sleepless nights may have led to some powerful ideas that ended up being game-changing, those ideas were only discovered after much… wasting time at 2am, when an idea came forth and that changed my world (…maybe a little bit, maybe a great deal). But it’s the process of exploring a question, going through the mental maze and hitting dead ends, and turning around and trying to find your way, maddeningly trying to find your way until — sometimes out of nowhere — you exit the maze.In other words, the process of thinking and getting stuck is maybe a necessary condition to real progress. It’s the struggle that propels you to think harder and to find a new part of the maze to explore. And most of the time, the exploration won’t lead you anywhere. But sometimes, after enough effort and time, you’ll find your way. And even if you don’t fully find your way or fully discover the answer, the process of trying will bring you closer, and that’s progress towards something.

Then think on this quote that you probably know, but don’t always appreciate: what got you here won’t get you there. I’ve uttered this statement no less than 100 times in my life, and until very recently, I didn’t really know what this meant.  What got you here was some way of doing your work that you likely honed through feedback from hard-working and/or smart people. You honed it over and over and over again, and now you’re _______. You feel good about yourself because you’ve achieved something. You’ve grown!But then one day you wake up and do what many people before you have done. You say, “I’m going to do something different.” You change your job or company, you move to a different city, you go back to school, you take some time out of the workforce. Whatever you do, you decide that your path ahead will look fundamentally different than your path to here. When you make this brave, exhilarating choice to eschew the safety of the known for the potential of the unknown, you are committing yourself to evolve. And real evolution feels uncomfortable. You have some choices when this discomfort occurs: You can resist the discomfort and give upYou can “try” to embrace it and you’ll feel constant friction as you seemingly force yourself to grow, or…You can embrace the idea that you actually don’t know anything. That henceforth you’re going to dig into your propensity to learn. You’ll ask tons of questions, you’ll “pre-worry” about why you’re going to fail and you’ll use these “pre-worrying” points (shout out to Dave Payne for the terminology!) to drive pro-active processing with the people around you in the new environment. You’ll do this regularly, often, and you’ll be excited about finding what’s somewhat broken about your own mental / operating modelThe reward will be that you will be in greater control of your success. You’ll explore what you can change / grow into, and what is simply not possible for you. You’ll gain the clarity that results in: I’m great / have the potential to be great at X, andI am awful and cannot “growth mindset” myself into being great at YSo, I will work on teams where other people have Y, but maybe lack XAnd together we’ll do more than we could do on our ownThis ability to un-learn is probably the most important thing for anyone who wants to continue to do new things and actually have fun while doing it. Throwing your ego out of the window a bit and just going back into learn-it-all mode (as Satya Nadella loves to say). I mean, who are you trying to impress? No one’s got it all, and it’s better to embrace it and grow than to fake it and stagnate. I think if you can learn to unlearn, you’ll experience greater joy in your (professional) life. Suddenly there’s less friction when something is uncomfortable. Instead, the discomfort is an opportunity to peek at and discover your future self…The future self that worked through it and found a new way.2Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#71 - Learning to UnlearnCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Here’s an actual example of me unlearning something. That thing? Unleashing the kitchen sink in response to a question. I’ve had this not-great habit for a long-time of sometimes over-explaining things. It probably comes from a sense of feeling that the person on the other ends of my word must understand what I am saying. If they don’t understand what I’m saying, then I’ve failed to communicate. And that feels shitty. Few things are more unpleasant than someone saying, “I don’t get it” after you’ve just explained something to them. Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribeFor a while, I generally got away with doing this, but recently — as I’ve been unlearning some sub-optimal habits, I realized that there is something sad about throwing the kitchen sink at someone in response to every question. If you ask me, “Michael, why should I listen to Nine Inch Nails?” (one of my favorite artists), I have two ways to respond. Approach 1: Kitchen Sinky — “NIN oozes angst. The production is badass. Trent’s vocals are iconic. Their catalogue is extensive and just plain rocks. You should check out their album With Teeth as a good entry point before you go into the deeper stuff like The Downward Spiral. This one time, I actually met Trent Reznor, and it changed my life. This is a life-changing artist for many people. (by this point you’re not listening anymore)”Approach 2: Pithy & Powerful — “If you love electronic music infused with a backbone of ambient rock n’ roll, listen to Nine Inch Nails”Approach 1 took 71 characters. Approach 2 is 19. In other words, the first approach is 3.7x longer. Brevity isn’t always the answer, but if you’re optimizing for someone else understanding / remembering your words, Approach 2 is — all else equal — going to be more effective. There are times when the kitchen sink is warranted, but imagine if you asked me 10 questions and I gave you Approach 1 every time? Maybe that’s totally fine. But maybe you’re doing Approach 1 when it’s one of the most important meetings of your life. Maybe you’re doing it when you’re trying to close a new customer, or maybe you’re doing it when you’re trying to turn a No into a Yes at work. The problem with always throwing the kitchen sink is that it tends to water down the power of your words immensely. Let’s look at Approach 1 again, but let’s turn it into a more Pithy & Powerful answer: “Nine Inch Nails oozes angst.” That one line breathes. It has space. There’s nothing else competing for your attention. Is it comprehensive? No. But you’re allowing 100% of the attention to be focused on one sentence with two powerful words: oozes and angst. And you are giving the other person the time and space to construct their own reality around what this statement actually means. As they consider this statement, they’re playing with it…exploring it, and this consideration is the beginning of understanding. Generally, humans aren’t great at balancing more than three concepts in their brain at once. Giving them one concept is a recipe to increase the odds that they remember what you’ve said. Two people in my life recently have helped me re-learn and re-appreciate the power of being concise. Here’s the feedback they gave me: Person 1: “I get the sense you’re a kitchen sink guy. You’ve got a lot to say, and it’s good, but I worry that you’re throwing the kitchen sink at every question.” Then about a month later, another advisor / backer of mine said this after assessing how I was responding to some questions. Person 2: “Michael, I think my feedback will generally come down to one thing. You have three answers for everything…. You need one.”Why does this matter? Is this overkill? In some contexts, thinking like this is overkill. If you want to monologue for 5 minutes and the people around you seem game for that, then do it. But there are times when you don’t have the luxury of five minutes and a lot of patience. There are times when you only have 30 seconds (max) to communicate an idea, and if you don’t do it effectively, you lose. I’ll continue to explore this idea in future letters, because it’s something I continue to work on every day. I still find myself providing the kitchen sink sometimes (and again…sometimes it is perfectly acceptable), but I’m working on doing this less… On being more thoughtful about the places where I give three answers instead of one.And if you’re a fellow founder / product designer reading this, a friendly reminder to give your most powerful ideas space to breathe. When you hone in on the the most powerful part of whatever it is you are building… let it breathe…let it breathe… (lest you suffocate the ideas by packing it into a clown-car of other ideas). Less is more. Simple products and simple value props > complex products and muddled value props.Thanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!

Don’t congratulate yourselves too much for “traction.” For it does not mean you have product-market fit.We all work hard and look for ways to confirm that we’re accomplishing what we set out to. I will never forget the constant need to “demonstrate value” in a former career, even when it was questionable if we were driving any. So, in this drive to demonstrate value, one can become skilled at listing out the outputs. “I sent 100 e-mails to prospects last week!” “I created a new framework to help drive clarity” “We hired a new head of XYZ.” “We had 50 meetings last week!” …But what was actually achieved? The best founders and leaders I’ve met and learned from focus on actual results and outcomes. But that’s not where they stop. Maybe our outcomes, those oh-so-cherished accomplishments aren’t actually enough. That might seem harsh, and certainly admitting that to yourself after working your ass off on something isn’t going to feel great, but it can be incredibly freeing to embrace reality. What I’m saying here certainly applies to every one of us, but I’m going to shift for a moment to startups and the hunt for product-market fit for a minute. Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when publishedSide note: Produt-Market Fit (PMF) is the point at which a product satisfies strong market demand, evidenced by high customer retention, organic growth, and time and cost-efficient acquisition, repeatably over time. Yes, this means a company can find PMF one quarter and then lose it the next. Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when publishedOver the last couple of years, I’ve immersed myself in everything around PMF (I particularly enjoy PMF Method by First Round Capital and Arc by Sequoia Capital). One of my big takeaways from consuming and applying much of this content is that most people who think they have PMF don’t actually have it. They may have some degree of PMF, but not full-blown \"dear god we cannot keep up or hire fast enough to meet demand\" PMF. You think people love and care about your product? They probably don’t. You believe you have got the model dialed in because you’ve been working on it — achieving some outcomes — for a couple of years? Doesn’t necessarily mean you’re any closer to product-market fit. Don’t delude yourselfv20 of a product doesn’t mean it’s working. It just means you’re at v20You think you can scale? Stop thinking about scale. You barely have any customers, and the ones you have are churning. Thinking about scale is almost always (but not always) a waste of timeYou think this thing can get huge because people tell you how special it is? Maybe so. Maybe they’re just being nice to you because saying the nice things is easier than saying the hard thingsIn studying people who have been able to find and keep product-market fit, they embrace one thing early and obsess over it. The power of the pivot. Sure, some founders start off with a concept, and then that exact concept is what they scale into a huge outcome. However, most founders (at least the ones I know) pivoted their way over and over and over again until they landed on the right model. Finding this illusive model that has PMF requires you to be an artisan — someone who crafts products with an incredible attention to detail, and with a habit of iteration and experimentation. And the thing about artisans is that most of their iterations won’t work. In almost every craft, people iterate 100s of times with different designs before finding the creation that has the potential to impact the world in a meaningful way.I’m thinking about this today because I’ve seen many entrepreneurs commit to hard to a path and embrace this whole notion of the founder willing it into existence and just being persistent and just waiting for the market timing to change… These things are all valuable, but it shouldn’t distract you from being an artisan, assuming that your product is fundamentally broken, and iterating with greater speed and urgency. I practice everything I’m writing. Homegrown is doing well. I can easily (and justifiably) write to you about how amazing things are and how we’re going to be an even bigger, more important company one day. But we’re only going to get there — to that target state of giant impact — by embracing what I’ve written here. Despite strong revenue, despite repeat customers, despite high demand, etc. etc., I still embrace the reality that we’re somewhat broken, so that I can find the product version that satisfies me. I’m not deluding myself that our achievements are the achievements I want most, and that’s why we’re going to win, because I’m not satisfied yet with the value we provide to our customers, and I probably won’t ever be. That lack of satisfaction is what sparks the drive — the desire — to be better. P.S. the picture for this article is my chief of staff and I working later at night on a recent trip. We’re having a great f*cking time building this thang!SubscribeShare1Share this postExonomist by Michael Davis#73 - Artisan Founders, PMF, and HonestyCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

And then once you’ve made that decision — that commitment — inertia surrounds you and everyone around you and then you get after it. That should happen less. I think there’s great power in actually being purposeful in adopting points of view, even after you’ve made a decision.  By doing this, you get to “live” in different contexts, exploring the crevices of an idea or concept or path… mining the good stuff from that area, before you purposefully shift to a different one and repeat. Here’s the example today: You decide that your team is going to launch new onboarding experience to give people hands-on guidance as they learn about and ultimately decide to use your product. Your team does all the research on the market, the tactics; you liked some LinkedIn post thatwas structuredlike thisto make sureyou get the pointand keep scrollingto learn that human-led onboarding is super powerfulso that you ultimately like whatever they posted, because everyone’s doing this approach nowSo, you make the decision and start building your new experience and even testing it. Great, right? Maybe. The problem here is that people go so deep on this approach, that they might lose sight of the merits of one others. This is why you should have structured oscillation. Someone on the team (you) should be thinking: “Well, what if humans could NEVER talk to a customer when they onboard? What would we do then?” —> And then you should just stay in that questioning zone. You should think deeply about that zone, and maybe you convince yourself that it’s the better approach. This is the point where you absolutely f*ck inertia and go back to your team and say, “Folks, I know we made the decision to go down this path. OK, but work with m here: what if …..” and then make your case again. Debate, overcome the “ugh, dude, no. We’ve already made the decision” because your job shouldn’t be to just produce outputs, it should be to achieve the goal, and it turns out there are usually multiple ways to achieve it. And then after these contemplations, these moments of frustration, you oscillate back to the group’s POV, but maybe in that journey to the other view you found something golden that helps make the original strategy more powerful.ShareSubscribeShare this postExonomist by Michael Davis#74 - Controlled OscillationCopy linkFacebookEmailNotesMoreShare",

Go. Cities should stop trying to be the Silicon Valley of X. I understand why they do it — the communications people are in the slipstream of an established narrative in the world. In other words, it’s sometimes easier and more effective to stand out by hitching your wagon to an established narrative. But just because I understand, doesn’t mean I agree. I usually don’t.For example, Dallas Fort Worth. DFW’s economic base is anchored by logistics, aerospace, defense, financial services, and a rapidly growing tech sector, fueled by business-friendly policies and population growth. In contrast, San Francisco’s economy is dominated by high-growth technology, venture capital, and professional services, but is increasingly burdened by high costs, outmigration, and regulatory complexity. But shit on SF all you want, it’s the capital of the world for AI right now, and most people know this.So, should a metro area like DFW or Atlanta try to be Silicon Valley? No. This morning, I caught up with my friend Avoilan who has done a beautiful job of bringing various aspects of Atlanta’s entrepreneurial ecosystem together (check out Render), and as we talked it occurred to me that cities like Atlanta should be what they are, and lean into their unique strengths, and then make sure the world knows about it. They shouldn’t simply try to be another place.  To borrow a corny quote I’ve always liked, “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”Metropolitan areas should be themselves and lean into what makes them unique. For example, I think Atlanta’s overall entrepreneurial ecosystem is incredible. No, I’m not just defining that as VC-backed technology founders. I’ve been in many conversations where I say this and I can sense the skepticism from my friend who lives walking distance from OpenAI in SF. The problem is that our modern information ecosystem has tightly connected the word “founder” or “entrepreneur” with technology companies. This is an excessively narrow view. So much of the country’s economic impact and, hell, the pursuit of happiness, comes from a tapestry of entrepreneurship that extends beyond pure technology companies.…And each city / metro area has its own unique mix of entrepreneurial activity. It’s why I used to get so frustrated when I’d hear someone at a bar in Flatiron (Manhattan) say something like, “Oh Chicago f*cking sucks!” — a city that is overflowing with entrepreneurial and small business goodness (…alright maybe this was just a New Yorker embracing the ol’ past-time of shitting on my original hometown, but I digress)…Back on track: the trap so many people fall into is what I’ll call the Information Gravity Trap… It’s when you let one narrative control how you think about an entire larger category. Let me explain: SF defines the word “founder” and “startup” as being about technology companies. They write tens of thousands of articles that reinforce this idea. Your podcasts feature people from there. The movies you watch allude to it. People in that system make billions of dollars —> leads media to pick up their definitions more because they are given more of the attention budgetOver time, their definitions and words begin to distribute themselves across America and more people accept their definition. Their definition gets distributedEventually the SF way cascades across the U.S., and over many years people get conditioned to pay attention to founders and startups that build technology companies. You can’t escape it, it’s everywhereBut the trap is thinking that the way they groomed the narrative is the truth or reality for everywhere. The Gravity…the weight of one city’s wording now influences everywhere, sometimes excluding entire categories (e.g., the founder of a neighborhood nail salon or coffee company — they are founders…owners, too).To avoid the trap, recognize that how we define categories can oftentimes be way too narrow; expand your perspective                           Narratives gain mass and gravity the more they are repeated                                         side note: I’m not a gravitational physicistIf you’re the mayor of Atlanta (what’s up, Andre!!), you can do a few things with this, but the main thing I’d argue for is to acknowledge that the very terms we accept have been influenced by another player for whom those words are beneficial.  After acknowledging this reality, I’d suggest coming up with new terms that more appropriately describe what is unique about your city. There’s a wholly-unique dynamism in places like Atlanta and DFW and Tampa Bay and Nashville and Charlotte that flat-out does not exist in other places like Seattle or Chicago. Doesn’t mean that Seattle and Chicago aren’t great (i’ve lived in both places, they are), but each city is highly unique, filled with both redeeming and perhaps regrettable characteristics. Why spend time thinking about this? Well, each city is an organization, and how that organization performs directly influences the quality of life for the people there. How we position cities is analogous to how we position companies.This lens of viewing cities as organizations was something I first gleaned from Mary Meeker. Back in 2015, I read her report called USA, Inc., and ended up actually printing out the entire report and taking notes all over it. It’s a review of the USA as if it were a publicly-traded company. She recently published a new addition in March of 2025. While she doesn’t directly get into the strategic positioning of different parts of the USA, she did/does apply a way we think about business to the government. I’m suggesting we do similar here. Just like businesses must stand out in a crowded market, so too must cities stand out in a crowded market of other geographies that are fighting for talent and growth.Timer says 13 minutes, so I overshot this a bit, but will pause here. As a side note, I’m starting to think WAY more about this after we launched the Thriving Cities Fund at Homegrown, in partnership with Flock Safety. We are doing real work to help all of our cities grow, by funding the brick & mortar entrepreneurs within them, and as we’ve started to traverse the country, I’ve come to appreciate each place we go for whatever makes that place unique.MDThanks for reading Exonomist by Michael Davis!
