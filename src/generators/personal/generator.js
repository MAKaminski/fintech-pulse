But for me? I actually light up when I dive into the P&L‚Äîcall me clich√©, but I really love EBITDA growth. (Yes, I'm that guy. No, I'm not fixing the planet‚Äîjust building businesses, one margin point at a time.)

üîß What I'm Evaluating Right Now
Full‚Äëstack builder: fluent in frontend, backend, accounting, legal‚Äîliterally full‚Äëstack.

üß± How I Work
Find the friction‚Äîthen remove it (preferably before someone notices it's gone).

Scale revenue by aligning product, pricing, and process.

Optimize capital deployment‚Äîbecause if you're going to spend, might as well make it count.

Operate end‚Äëto‚Äëend: from drafting legal terms to shipping the finished product‚Äîno silos here.

üéØ Why I'm Posting
I'm humbled by what I've learned lately, and excited for where I go next. If you're looking for someone who can speak both JavaScript and GAAP, deploy with one hand while negotiating with the other‚Äîand does it all with a smile‚Äîlet's talk.

üîß What I'm Evaluating Right Now
Technical architecture that supports business growth and scales with demand.

Data analytics that inform strategic decisions and drive measurable outcomes.
